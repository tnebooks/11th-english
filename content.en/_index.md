**ENERAL ENGLISH**
  

Unit 1 –The Portrait of a Lady is a biographical sketch describing the bond between a grandson and his grandmother, filling the mind with reminiscences of the past. Children identify their personal relationship with their own grandparents and learn humane qualities of kindness, respecting the old and showing concern to their relations.

The feelings and actions of fellow human beings have to be trusted and given due respect.

being young and pretty, the thought was almost revolting. She often told us of the games she used to play as a child. That seemed quite **absurd** and undignified on her part and we treated it like the **fables** of the Prophets she used to tell us.

She had always been short and fat and slightly bent. Her face was a criss-cross of wrinkles running from everywhere to everywhere. No, we were certain she had always been as we had known her. Old, so terribly old that she could not have grown older, and had stayed at the same age for twenty years. She could never have been pretty; but she was always beautiful. She **hobbled** about the house in spotless white with one hand resting on her waist to balance her stoop and the other telling the beads of her rosary. Her silver locks were scattered untidily over her pale, **puckered** face, and her lips constantly moved in inaudible

prayer. Yes, she was beautiful. She was like the winter landscape in the mountains, an **expanse** of pure white serenity breathing peace and contentment.

My grandmother and I were good friends. My parents left me with her when they went to live in the city and we were constantly together. She used to wake me

in the morning and get me ready for ol. She said her morning prayer in a **otonous** sing-song while she bathed

dressed me in the hope that I would n and get to know it by heart; I listened use I loved her voice but never ered to learn it. Then she would fetch

wooden slate which she had already hed and plastered with yellow chalk, y earthen ink-pot and a red pen, tie all in a bundle and hand it to me.

r a breakfast of a thick, stale chapatti a little butter and sugar spread on it, ent to school. She carried several stale attis with her for the village dogs.

My grandmother always went to ol with me because the school was

ched to the temple. The priest taught he alphabet and the morning prayer. ile the children sat in rows on either of the verandah singing the alphabet e prayer in a chorus, my grandmother

nside reading the scriptures. When we both finished, we would walk back ther. This time the village dogs would t us at the temple door. They followed

o our home growling and fighting with other for the chapatti we threw to .

When my parents were comfortably led in the city, they sent for us. That a turning-point in our friendship. ough we shared the same room, my dmother no longer came to school me. I used to go to an English school

motor bus. There were no dogs in the ets and she took to feeding sparrows e courtyard of our city house.

As the years rolled by, we saw less of

each other. For some time she continued to wake me up and get me ready for school. When I came back she would ask me what the teacher had taught me. I would tell her English words and little things of western science and learning, the law of gravity, Archimedes’ Principle, the world being round etc. This made her unhappy. She could not help me with my lessons. She did not believe in the things they taught at the English school and was distressed that there was no teaching about God and the scriptures. One day, I announced that we were being given music lessons. She said nothing but her silence meant disapproval. She rarely talked to me after that.

When I went up to University, I was given a room of my own. The common link of friendship was **snapped**. My grandmother accepted her **seclusion** with resignation. She rarely left her spinning- wheel to talk to anyone. From sunrise to sunset she sat by her wheel spinning and reciting prayers. Only in the afternoon she relaxed for a while to feed the sparrows. While she sat in the verandah breaking the bread into little bits, hundreds of little birds collected round her creating a veritable **bedlam** of chirruping. Some

came and **perched** on her legs, others on her shoulders. Some even sat on her head.

When I decided to go abroad for her studies, I was sure my grandmother ld be upset. I would be away for five s, and at her age one could never tell.

my grandmother could. She was not sentimental. She came to leave me at

railway station but did not talk or show emotion. Her lips moved in prayer, mind was lost in prayer. Her fingers

e busy telling the beads of her rosary. ntly she kissed my forehead, and when ft I cherished the moist imprint as aps the last sign of physical contact een us.

But that was not so. After five years I e back home and was met by her at the

ion. She did not look a day older. She had no time for words, and while she ped me in her arms I could hear her ting her prayers. Even on the first day y arrival, her happiest moments were her sparrows whom she fed longer

with frivolous **rebukes**.

In the evening a change came over She did not pray. She collected the

en of the neighbourhood, got an drum and started to sing. For several rs she thumped the sagging skins of the **pidated** drum and sang of the home- ing of warriors. We had to persuade to stop to avoid overstraining. That

the first time since I had known her she did not pray.

The next morning she was taken ill. as a mild fever and the doctor told

us that it would go. But my grandmother thought differently. She told us that her end was near. She said that, since only a few hours before the close of the last chapter of her life she had omitted to pray, she was not going to waste any more time talking to us.

We protested. But she ignored our protests. She lay peacefully in bed praying and telling her beads. Even before we could suspect, her lips stopped moving and the rosary fell from her lifeless fingers. A peaceful **pallor** spread on her face and we knew that she was dead.

We lifted her off the bed and, as is customary, laid her on the ground and covered her with a red **shroud**. After a few hours of mourning we left her alone to make arrangements for her funeral. In the evening we went to her room with a crude stretcher to take her to be cremated. The sun was setting and had lit her room and verandah with a blaze of golden light. We stopped half-way in the courtyard. All over the verandah and in her room right up to where she lay dead and stiff wrapped in the red shroud, thousands of sparrows sat scattered on the floor. There was no chirruping. We felt sorry for the birds and my mother fetched some bread for them. She broke it into little crumbs, the way my grandmother used to, and threw it to them. The sparrows took no notice of the bread. When we carried my grandmother’s corpse off, they flew away quietly. Next morning the sweeper swept the bread crumbs into the dustbin.

e) Prefixes and Suffixes.

“Her silver locks were scattered untidily over her pale, puckered face, and her lips constantly moved in **inaudible** prayer.”

In the above sentence, the word ‘inaudible’ is formed by adding the prefix **in-** to the root/base word ‘audible’.

A **prefix** is a letter or a group of letters which is added to the beginning of a root word in order to modify it. Usually, the new word formed is the opposite of the given word.

In the above sentence, we also come across the word ‘constantly’. Here the suffix **–ly** is added to the root word ‘constant’.

A **suffix** is a letter or a group of letters added to the end of a root word. By adding suffixes, the grammatical function of the word changes.

Words that are derived or formed from the base word by adding prefixes and suffixes are called **derivatives**.

**Form two derivatives from each of the**

**following words**.

According to Edward Fry, there are three reading speeds: Study reading speed, Average reading speed and Skimming speed. Study reading speed is generally used to read material which demands total comprehension and retention of its meaning, for example, while preparing for an examination. Average reading speed is used for everyday reading of newspapers, magazines and novels etc. Skimming is the fastest reading speed and is generally used for getting an overall idea of the material read. Scanning is another useful tool for speeding up reading. While scanning, you look for specific information without reading everything.

A few practical hints to help you do activities under reading comprehension passages:

1\. Read the passage carefully and try to grasp its main theme.

2\. Pay attention to the meanings of words (connotation), phrases and sentences.

3\. Grasp the manner in which the writer has developed his ideas and thoughts.

4\. Read all the questions in the sequence and conceptualize the answers.

5\. Read the passage again focussing on the content and answer the questions appropriately. Find accurate solutions for vocabulary exercises too.

6\. Go through your answers to check spelling, punctuation and grammar.

Twenty minutes of laughter is sufficient to augment physiological development.

Good morning everyone! Respected Principal, teachers and friends; I am Kumar of Class XI and I stand before you to share a few thoughts on the importance of games and sports in our lives.

Most of us spend our leisure time indoors, watching TV or playing video games. This makes us physically lazy and also leads to many diseases. Mentally we become dull and unimaginative. But all this can be reversed with regular sports activities.

First of all, sports makes us mentally alert and physically strong. Further, good health is one of the most important benefits of games and sports. They help us relax and give us energy to learn our lessons well. Playing games also helps in developing a sense of cooperation or team-spirit in an individual. For example, games like cricket, football, etc. are won by the collective efforts of all the members of the team. They shape our body, give us energy and strength and improve blood circulation.

Sports should be an integral part of education. Education without sports is incomplete. Thus, we should understand that sports is of great value in life. That is why facilities are being developed in rural and semi-urban areas. There are playgrounds everywhere. Let us all remember that a healthy mind can be only in a healthy body and that health is wealth.

I wish to thank you all for having given me the opportunity to speak on the importance of sports and games. Let us pledge to keep ourselves healthy and active by participating more and more in outdoor activities.

Task XI, you ‘Rea deli

and slight **swagger**, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The **vicinity** was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed.

When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly.

“It’s all right, officer,” he said, **reassuringly**. “I’m just waiting for a friend. It’s an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little funny to you, doesn’t it? Well, I’ll explain if you’d like to make certain it’s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands—Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant.”

“Until five years ago,” said the policeman. “It was torn down then.”

The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarf pin was a large diamond, oddly set.

“Twenty years ago tonight,” said the man, “I dined here at Big Joe Brady’s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to start for

We figured that wenty years each of us ought to have destiny worked out and our fortunes e, whatever they were going to be.”

“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the ceman. “Rather a long time between ts, though, it seems to me. Haven’t you

The waiting man pulled out a dsome watch, the lids of it set with ll diamonds.

“Three minutes to ten,” he announced. as exactly ten o’clock when we parted at the restaurant door.”

“Did pretty well out West, didn’t ?” asked the policeman.

“You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half ell. He was a kind of **plodder**, though,

good fellow as he was. I’ve had to compete with some of the sharpest **wits** going to get my pile. A man gets in a **groove** in New York. It takes the West to put a **razor-edge**

The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.

“I’ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to call time on him sharp?”

“I should say not!” said the other. “I’ll give him half an hour at least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time. So long, officer.”

“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he went.

There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried **dismally** and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware

career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest.

At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other’s face. The man from the West stopped sud- denly and released his arm.

“You’re not Jimmy Wells,” he snapped. “Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change a man’s nose from a Roman to a pug.”

“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one”, said the tall man. “You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob. Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and **wires** us she wants to have a chat with you. Going quietly, are you? That’s sensible. Now, before we go on to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it here at the window. It’s from Patrolman Wells.”

The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed to him. His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the time he had finished. The note was rather short.

the AIBA) World Women’s Boxing Championships in Pennsylvania, USA, in November–December 2001.

My father managed to collect only Rs 2,000 for my trip. I was both upset and very worried because I’d heard of

how expensive things were in America. But there was nothing my parents or I could do. I spoke to Onler, one of my friends, about my problem. He invited a few students and elders, who went to meet the two Members of Parliament and seek their help. Two MPs donated Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 3,000 respectively and I suddenly had Rs 10,000 in my hands. With this **princely** sum, and a little more that had been collected from people, I left for the US. I was relieved to have money in my pocket, and knew that I could not come back empty-handed after all the efforts that people had made on my behalf.

Pennsylvania was cold and beautiful. It was snowing. We were confined to the sports arena, but what little I saw was pleasing to the eye. The people were enormously nice too. It was the first time in my life that I had travelled so far. I was looking forward to seeing what America was all about. But since we were the last team to arrive, we went straight to the sporting arena from the airport. The other

est well enough to face my opponent he round, which I won comfortably. fear of facing new opponents quickly ished. I competed in the 48 kg in this mpionship. While team-mates lost after the other, I went on to reach the ls. I was even hopeful of winning the . The boxers were not unbeatable as I

earlier thought.

I felt like this would be the place, event that would change my life.

pt telling myself, “I can face anyone in ring.” In the quarter–final, I defeated ia Hokmi of Poland by RSC (Referee ped Contest–applicable if the referee

s one of the boxers is inferior to the r and risks getting hurt badly), and in semi-final, I defeated Jamie Behal of ada by 21-9. I reached the finals, but to Hula Sahin of Turkey by 13-5.

The greatest disadvantage for me was loss of **appetite**. I was not accustomed he food there. Try as I might, I could

eat the food and I started to lose ht. So much so that just before the

ls I was only 46 kg. This is probably t cost me my dream of winning gold I was very disappointed. I went to room and cried. But the coaches were ; they consoled me and **lauded** me on

silver win. I was the only one in the to get a medal. But the biggest thing
  

**36**

I took away from this championship was the **conviction** that I could take on any boxer.

In the course of my career, I have become used to travel and to the different ways that things work in other countries. One time, in China, we were given chopsticks to eat our meals with. Just when I had painfully begun to master the art of using a knife and fork, I had to use two sticks to fill my stomach. I ended up using both my hands to hold the chopstick to pick up the food and push it into my mouth. My teammates asked for spoons but I tried to manage with the sticks. It helped that I really enjoy Chinese food. I was hungry enough that I managed the complex work required – I ate enough to **sate** my appetite and my **palate**. After five years of travelling, I started taking along some packed food from home.

On my return, Delhi gave me a warm welcome at the airport. Back in Imphal, I was greeted with garlands and drumbeats and dancing. There was a victory ride across town, a **felicitation** programme was held in Langol, an area that houses the government quarters. Thanksgiving prayers were said and words of praise and **adulation** were showered on me. I was presented with a traditional shawl. Oja Ibomcha was also present and was duly felicitated. When I spoke to the people in Langol that day, I spoke of my hope that I would win gold in future tournaments.

That first international medal, a silver, will always mean a lot to me. The fight and all that followed are clearly **etched** in my memory. But deep inside, I was not happy

a silver. As I touched down in India, wed that the next time I would bring a gold. I knew I was good enough.

The silver in Pennsylvania and the e money from the government had an end to my immediate financial

ries. But I wanted a job too, for that e can bring long-term security and a dy income. Also, around the time that as getting married, I had no savings pt a couple of life insurance policies. r my second World Championship , the Manipur government offered the post of Sub-Inspector, which I pted in 2005. I had long dreamt of ing a government job through the rts quota, and it was finally fulfilled. I ed a salary of Rs. 15,000 in that first

The thing about jobs that are obtained ugh the sports quota is that we are not ired to go in to work as regularly as

colleagues because we tend to be away amps and tournaments through much

title in the Third World Women’s Boxing Championships at Podolsk in Russia, in 2005. Sarita, who had won the bronze, and I were given a hero’s welcome at the Imphal airport. We were taken to the Bhagyachandra Open Air Theatre, where a grand reception was organised.

I’d had a good run from 2001 to 2004. I won several golds: all the Senior Women’s Boxing Championships; the 2nd Women’s Boxing Championships, 2002; the 2nd Asian Women’s Boxing Championships at Hisar in 2003; and the Witch Cup Boxing Championships at Paes, Hungary. In spite of this, when I got married, everybody was doubtful that my medal hauls would continue. But after the wedding, I participated in and won a gold in the Third and Fourth World Women’s Boxing Championships in October 2005 and November 2006.

There were a number of other international level championships, in Taiwan, Vietnam, Denmark and so on. But it was retaining my world title in 2006 by defeating Steluta Duta of Romania 22-7 at the Fourth World Championships in New Delhi that I consider one of my greatest achievements. It is probably the most memorable for me because I was able to win at home. The other Indian boxers also performed exceptionally well. India won four golds, one silver and three bronzes, and our team won the overall title. With this hat-trick of World Championship wins, the media christened me ‘Queen of Boxing’ and ‘Magnificent Mary’.

**Reading**

Encoding and Decoding

We can present information or data in a visual form through tables, graphs etc., or in a verbal form as reports or articles.

Tables and figures make the presentation not only simple and clear but attractive as well.

Encoding and Decoding are two common and useful strategies in presenting data or facts.

**Encoding** is the process by which data (facts, figures, etc.) is presented in a non- verbal form, i.e., as tables, graphs, etc.

**Decoding** is the process by which graphic representations such as tables and graphs are interpreted so that the data is made meaningful to the readers.

Read the following paragraph and see how notes have been made on it.

1.The Rome 1960 Paralympic Games was a tremendous step in sports for athletes with a physical impairment. The founder of the Paralympics movement, Sir Ludwig Guttmann, and the director of the spinal centre in Rome, Antonia Maglio, started preparations for the games two years ago. It would be called the 9th

Annual International Stoke Mandeville Games. Now regarded as the Rome 1960 Paralympic Games, the competition took place for six days following the closing ceremony of the XVII Olympic Games and was supported by the Italian Olympic Committee and the Italian Institute for Disabled Workers.

2\. A total of eight different sports events debuted at the first-ever paralympic Games, all of which were considered beneficial and suitable for athletes with spinal cord injuries: archery, IPC athletics, dart, snooker, IPC swimming, table tennis, wheelchair-basketball and wheelchair fencing.

3\. The opening ceremony on 18 September 1960 garnered a crowd of 5000 spectators, which greeted the wheelchair athletes during their colourful entry into Acqua Acetosa stadium. The Italian Minister for Public Health at the time, officially declared the games open to the world. In the debut of the Paralympic games on the world stage, the host nation Italy finished atop the medal standings, as Great Britain, Germany, Austria and the USA rounded out the top five with stellar performances.

Looking at the modern children, one striking difference between the childhood that the previous generation had and the one that this generation has is the lack of Indian or native games. In the 1970’s, people used to play a variety of indoor and outdoor games that were the

Paralympic Games

In 1960, Sir Ludwig Guttmann founded the Paralympic Games in Rome for the physically impaired. The games, supported by Italian Olympic Committee and the Italian Institute for Disabled Workers, took place for six days. Eight different sports events conducted were suitable for the disabled. During the opening ceremony on 18th September, five thousand spectators greeted the wheelchair athletes’ colourful entry. The host Italy finished atop and during the closing ceremony, the founder said that the Games were a new pattern of re-integration of the paralysed into society and sports.

**The Value of Games in Education**

**By M. Sathyapriya, XI-F**

The aim of education is to enable the human personality to grow to its full stature. We have a body, a mind and a spirit. Accordingly, education aims at our physical, intellectual, spiritual and moral development.

Games are a means of keeping the body healthy and fit. Physical fitness and freedom from all kinds of ailments are the desire and ambition of every human being. Indeed, good health is the first condition of happiness in life. Those who play games generally maintain good health. Games are an excellent means of bodily exercise. Whether it is sophisticated games like hockey, football and tennis or simple games like Kabaddi, they provide the much needed exercise to the body and thus keep the body healthy and strong. Players always have a better appetite and a better digestion than those who play no games or do exercises. Games not only make the body healthy and strong, but also make it muscular.

Apart from building the body, games are an excellent recreation or pastime. Education teaches people the need and

**Thinking**

“If you think you are beaten, you are, If you think you dare not, you don’t. If you like to win, but you think you can’t, It is almost certain you won’t.

If you think you’ll lose, you’re lost, For out in the world we find, Success begins with a fellow’s will. It’s all in the state of mind.

If you think you are outclassed, you are, You’ve got to think high to rise, You’ve got to be sure of yourself before You can ever win a prize.

Life’s battles don’t always go To the stronger or faster man. But soon or late the man who wins, Is the man who thinks he can.”

held for the Government in the present

Parliament by a gentleman who did not

intend to seek re-election, and Sletherby

was under serious consideration by the

party managers as his possible successor,

and with luck, the seat might be held. The

Saltpen-Jago influence was not an item

which could be left out of consideration,

and the political aspirant had been

delighted at meeting Honoria at a small

and friendly luncheon-party, still more

gratified when she had asked him down

to her country house for the following

Friday-to-Tuesday. He was obviously

‘on approval’, and if he could secure the

goodwill of his hostess he might count on

her nominating him as an assured thing.

If he failed to find favour in her eyes —

well, the local leaders would probably cool

off in their embryo enthusiasm for him.

Among the passengers dotted

about on the platform, awaiting their

respective trains, Sletherby **espied** a club

acquaintance, and called him up to the

carriage-window for a chat.

“Oh, you’re staying with

Mrs. Saltpen-Jago for the week-end, are

you? I expect you’ll have a good time; she

has the reputation of being an excellent

hostess. She’ll be useful to you, too, if that

Parliamentary project — hullo, you’re off.

“You’ve lost something, haven’t you?” said Sletherby.

“Not exactly, but left behind, which is almost as bad; just as inconvenient, anyway. I’ve come away without my sovereign-purse, with four **quid** in it, all my worldly wealth for the moment. It was in my pocket all right, just before I was starting, and then I wanted to seal a letter, and the sovereign-purse happens to have my crest on it, so I whipped it out to stamp the seal with, and, like a double-distilled idiot, I must have left it on the table. I had some silver loose in my pocket, but after I’d paid for a taxi and my ticket I’d only got this forlorn little six pence left. I’m stopping at a little country inn near Brondquay for three days’ fishing; not a soul knows me there, and my week-end bill, and tips, and cab to and from the station, and my ticket on to Brill, that will mount up to two or three quid, won’t it? If you wouldn’t mind lending me two pound ten, or three for preference, I shall be awfully obliged. It will pull me out of no end of a hole.”

“I think I can manage that,” said Sletherby, after a moment’s hesitation.

“Thanks awfully. It’s jolly good of you. What a lucky thing for me that I should have chanced across one of the mater’s friends. It will be a lesson to me not to leave my **exchequer** lying about anywhere, when it ought to be in my pocket. I suppose the moral of the whole thing is don’t try and convert things to purposes for which they weren’t intended. Still, when a sovereign-purse has your **crest** on it–”

“I’ve never met your mother,” Sletherby suddenly, “though e corresponded several times. My

oduction to her was through political nds. Does she resemble you at all in ure? I should rather like to be able to her out if she happened to be on the form to meet me.”

“She’s supposed to be like me. She the same dark brown hair and high

colour; it runs in her family. I say, this is where I get out.”

“Good-bye,” said Sletherby.

“You’ve forgotten the three quid,” said the young man, opening the carriage- door and pitching his suit-case on to the platform.

“I’ve no intention of lending you three pounds, or three shillings,” said Sletherby severely.

“But you said–”

“I know I did. My suspicions hadn’t been roused then, though I hadn’t necessarily swallowed your story. The **discrepancy** about the crests put me on my guard, notwithstanding the really brilliant way in which you accounted for it. Then I laid a trap for you; I told you that I had never met Mrs. Saltpen-Jago. As a matter of fact I met her at lunch on Monday last. She is a pronounced blonde.”

The train moved on, leaving the **soi-disant** cadet of the Saltpen-Jago family cursing furiously on the platform.

“Well, he hasn’t opened his fishing expedition by catching a flat,” chuckled Sletherby. He would have an entertaining story to recount at dinner that evening, and his clever little trap would earn him applause as a man of resource and **astuteness.** He was still telling his adventure in imagination to an attentive audience of dinner guests when the train drew up at his destination. On the platform he was greeted **sedately** by a tall footman, and noisily by Claude People, K.C., who had apparently travelled down by the same train.

The K.C. was not the sort of man to notice an absorbed silence on the part of a companion. He had been silent himself for nearly an hour in the train, and his tongue was making up for lost time. Political gossip, personal anecdote, and general observation flowed from him in an uninterrupted stream as the car sped along the country roads; from the inner history of the Dublin labour troubles and the private life of the Prince Designate of Albania he progressed with an easy **volubility** to an account of an alleged happening at the ninth hole at Sandwich, and a verbatim report of a remark made by the Duchess of Pathshire at a Tango tea. Just as the car turned in at the Brill entrance gates the K.C. captured Sletherby’s attention by switching his remarks to the personality of their hostess.

“Brilliant woman, level-headed, a clear thinker, knows exactly when to take up an individual or a cause, exactly when to let him or it drop. Influential woman, but spoils herself and her chances by being too restless. No repose. Good appearance, too, till she made that idiotic change.”

“Change?” queried Sletherby, “what change?”

“What change? You don’t mean to say– Oh, of course, you’ve only known her just lately. She used to have beautiful dark brown hair, which went very well with her fresh complexion; then one day, about five weeks ago, she electrified everybody by appearing as a brilliant **blonde**. Quite ruined her looks. Here we are. I say, what’s the matter with you? You look rather ill.”

common. It is

the efficiency

rather than the

inefficiency of

human memory

that compels my

wonder. Modern

man remembers

even telephone

numbers. He

remembers the

addresses of his friends. He remembers the

dates of good **vintages**.

He remembers appointments for

lunch and dinner. His memory is crowded

with the names of actors and actresses and

cricketers and footballers and murderers.

He can tell you what the weather was like

in a long-past August and the name of the

provincial hotel at which he had a vile meal

during the summer. In his ordinary life,

again, he remembers almost everything

that he is expected to remember. How

many men in all London forget a single

item of their clothing when dressing in the

morning? Not one in a hundred. Perhaps

not one in ten thousand. How many of

them forget to shut the front door when

leaving the house? Scarcely more. And so it

goes on through the day, almost everybody

remembering to do the right things at the

right moment till it is time to go to bed,

and then the ordinary man seldom forgets

to turn off the lights before going upstairs.

There are, it must be admitted, some

matters in regard to which the memory

works with less than its usual perfection. It

is only a very methodical man, I imagine,

who can always remember to take the

. This is the more surprising because

icine should be one of the easiest

gs to remember. As a rule, it is

posed to be taken before during, or

r meals and the meal itself should be a

inder of it. The fact remains, however,

few but the moral giants remember

ake their medicine regularly. Certain

hologists tell us that we forget things

use we wish to forget them, and it may

hat it is because of their **antipathy** to

and potions; that many people fail to

ember them at the appointed hours.

This does not explain, however, how

that a life-long devotee of medicines

myself is as forgetful of them as those

take them most unwillingly. The very

spect of a new and widely advertised

he commonest form of forgetfulness,

ppose, occurs in the matter of posting

rs. So common is it that I am always

**ctant** to trust a departing visitor to

t an important letter. So little do I rely

is memory that I put him on his oath

re handing the letter to him. As for

elf, anyone who asks me to post a letter

poor judge of character. Even if I carry

pillar-box before I remember that I

ht to have posted it. Weary of holding

my hand, I then put it for safety into

of my pockets and forget all about it.

r that, it has an unadventurous life till
  

**68**

a long chain of circumstances leads to a

number of embarrassing questions being

asked, and I am compelled to produce

the evidence of my guilt from my pocket.

This, it might be thought, must be due to

a lack of interest in other people’s letters;

but that cannot be the explanation, for I

forget to post some even of the few letters

that I myself remember to write.

As for leaving articles in trains and

in taxies, I am no great **delinquent** in such

matters. I can remember almost anything

except books and walking-sticks and I can

often remember even books. Walking-

sticks I find it quite impossible to keep.

I have an old-fashioned taste for them,

and I buy them frequently but no-sooner

do I pay a visit to a friend’s house or go a

journey in a train, than another stick is on

its way into the world of the lost. I dare

not carry an umbrella for fear of losing

it. To go through life without ever having

lost an umbrella- has even the grimmest—

jawed umbrella-carrier ever achieved this?

Few of us, however, have lost

much property on our travels through

forgetfulness. The ordinary man arrives

at his destination with all his bags and

trunks safe. The list of articles lost in

trains during the year suggests that it is

the young rather than the adult who forget

things, and that sportsmen have worse

memories than their ordinary serious-

minded fellows. A considerable number

of footballs and cricket-bats, for instance,

were forgotten. This is easy to understand,

for boys, returning from the games, have

their imaginations still filled with a vision

of the playing-field, and their heads are

among the stars — or their hearts in their

ts — as they recall their **exploits** or

from remembering to do such small

**saic** things as take the ball or the bat

them when they leave the train.

For the rest of the day, they are

ens of dreamland. The same may be

, no doubt, of anglers who forget their

ing-rods. Anglers are generally said —

not know with what justification- to

he most imaginative of men, and the

who is inventing magnificent lies on

journey home after a day’s fishing is

nd to be a little absent-minded in his

aviour. The fishing-rod of reality is

otten by him as he day-dreams over

fears of the fishing-rod of Utopia. His

of memory is really a tribute to the

nsity of his enjoyment in thinking

ut his day’s sport. He may forget his

ing-rod, as the poet may forget to post

tter, because his mind is filled with

ter more glorious.

Absent-mindedness of this kind

s to me all but a virtue. The absent-

ded man is often a man who is making

best of life and therefore has no time

emember the **mediocre**. Who would

e trusted Socrates or Coleridge to post

The question whether the possession

good memory is altogether desirable

often been discussed, and men with

**ble** memories have sometimes tried

ake out a case for their superiority.

embering machine is seldom a man

he first intelligence, and they quote
  

**69**

various cases of children or men who had marvellous memories and who yet had no intellect to speak of. I imagine, however, that on the whole the great writers and the great composers of music have been men with exceptional powers of memory. The poets I have known have had better memories than the stockbrokers I have known. Memory, indeed, is half the substance of their art.

On the other hand, statesmen seem to have extraordinarily bad memories. Let two statesmen attempt to recall the same event — what happened, for example, at some Cabinet meeting — and each of them will tell you that the other’s story is so inaccurate that either he has a memory like a **sieve** or is an **audacious** perverter of the truth. The frequency with which the facts in the autobiographies and speeches of statesmen are challenged, suggests that the world has not yet begun to produce ideal statesmen—men who, like great poets, have the genius of memory and of intellect combined.

At the same time, ordinarily good memory is so common that we regard a man who does not possess it as **eccentric**. I have heard of a father who, having offered to take the baby out in a perambulator, was tempted by the sunny morning to pause on his journey and slip into a public-house for a glass of beer. Leaving the perambulator outside, he disappeared through the door of the saloon bar. A little later, his wife had to do some shopping which took her past the public-house, where to her horror, she discovered her sleeping baby. **Indignant** at her husband’s behaviour, she decided to teach him a lesson.

What was **vexation**, however, when just before h her husband came in smiling rfully and asking: “Well, my dear, t’s for lunch today?” having forgotten bout the baby and the fact that he had n it out with him. How many men w the rank of a philosopher would capable of such absent-mindedness his? Most of us, I fear, are born with saically efficient memories. If it were so, the institution of the family could survive in any great modern city.

Human memory gins to work when the etus is just 20 weeks old the mother’s womb.

short stories. He has written 50 sci-fi short stories published in various Tamil magazines. His stories have inspired many readers to extend their reading to English sci-fi writers like Isaac Asimov.

4\. He has been a great writer for more than four decades. He combined reasoning and science in his writings. Being a multifaceted hi-fi and sci-fi humanistic author, he expressed his views distinctively. He was the one who took Tamil novels to the next level.

His readers always enjoyed reading all his detective and sci-fi novels which featured the most famous duo Ganesh and Vasanth.

**Summer Sun**

Great is the sun, and wide he goes Through empty heaven without repose; And in the blue and glowing days More thick than rain he showers his rays.

Though closer still the blinds we pull To keep the shady parlour cool, Yet he will find a chink or two To slip his golden fingers through.

The dusty attic spider-clad, He, through the keyhole, maketh glad; And through the broken edge of tiles, Into the laddered hay-loft smiles.  

ntime his golden face around bares to all the garden ground, sheds a warm and glittering look

ong the ivy’s inmost nook.

ve the hills, along the blue, nd the bright air with footing true, lease the child, to paint the rose, gardener of the World, he goes.

**In ‘Tight Corners’, E.V. Lucas narrates**

**the story of how he was rescued from**

**sudden stroke of luck. Let’s read on and**

**get to know how he got himself in a tight**

**corner and found his way out of that**

**situation.**

The talk was running on the critical situations in which we had found ourselves — those of us whose lives were adventurous enough to comprise any.

One man had been caught by the tide in **Brittany** and escaped by the skin of his teeth. Another had been on an elephant when a wounded tiger charged at it. A third had been on the top storey of a burning house. A fourth was torpedoed in the War.

“But you all talk,” said one of the company, “as though tight corners were always physical affairs. Surely they can be tighter when they are mental. The tightest comer I was ever in was at Christie’s.”

“Christie’s?”

“Yes. I had been lunching rather well at a club in **St. James’s Street** with an old friend from abroad, and passing along **King Street** afterwards, he persuaded me to look in at the sale-room. The place was full.

) Describe the activity that was going on in the sale-room at King Street.

) What can you say about the author’s attitude when he high-handedly participated in the auction?

You’ll get caught,’ my friend said to me.

No, I shan’t,” I said. “I’m not going o run any risks.”

) Why was the author sure he would not be caught?

) What made the author ignore his friend’s warning?

“And for a long time I didn’t. And then cture was put up and a short red- faced in a new top-hat — some well-known

ler — who had bought quite a number, **trified** the room by starting the ing at a figure a little higher than any

he had yet given or that anything had hed.
  

**106**

Although the previous lots had run into four figures they had all been modestly started at fifty guineas or a hundred guineas, with a gradual **crescendo** to which I had often been safely contributing. But no sooner was the new picture displayed than the dealer made his sensational bid, “Four thousand guineas,” he said.

e) How had the author managed the auction without getting involved in the deal?

There was a rustle of excitement, and at the end of it I heard my own voice saying, “And fifty!” A terrible silence followed, during which the auctioneer looked inquiringly first at the opener and then at the company generally.

To my surprise and horror the red- faced dealer gave no sign of life. I realized now, as I ought to have done at first, that he had shot his bolt.

f ) What came as a shock to the author?

“Four thousand and fifty guineas offered”, said the auctioneer, again searching the room.

My heart stopped; my blood **congealed**. There was no sound but a curious **smothered** noise from my friend.

Four thousand and fifty guineas. Any advance on four thousand and fifty guineas? — and the hammer fell.

g) What did the falling of the hammer indicate?

I was running over the names of les and other persons from whom it ht be possible to borrow, but wasn’t; dering if the moneylenders who talk **libly** about ‘**note of hand** only’ really n it; speculating on the possibility of fessing my poverty to one of Christie’s and having the picture put up again. t was the best way — and yet how ld I do it after all the other bids I had e? The staff looked so prosperous and

ympathetic, and no one would believe as a mistake. A genuine mistake of such nd would have been rectified at once.

) What kind of excuses did the narrator think he could make?
  

**107**

Meanwhile the sale came to an end and I stood on the outskirts of the little knot of buyers round the desk who were writing cheques and giving instructions. Naturally I preferred to be the last. It was there that I was joined by my friend; but only for a moment, for on a look at my face he rammed his handkerchief in his mouth and again disappeared. Alone I was to \***dree this awful weird.** I have never felt such a fool or had colder feet in all my life. I believe I should have welcomed a firing party.

j) Why did the friend desert the narrator, a second time?

And then the unexpected happened, and I realized that a career of **rectitude** sometimes has rewards beyond the mere consciousness of virtue. A voice at my ear suddenly said, ‘Beg pardon. Sir, but was you the gent that bought the big Daubigny?”

I admitted it.

“Well, the gent who offered four thousand guineas wants to know if you’ll take fifty guineas for your bid.”

If ever a messenger of the high gods wore a green **baize** apron and spoke in husky Cockney tones this was he. I could have embraced him and wept for joy. Would I take fifty guineas. Why, I would have taken fifty **farthings.**

**About the Author**

Edward Verrall Lucas, (1868 – 1938) was an English humourist, essayist, playwright, biographer, publisher, poet, novelist, short story writer and editor. Born to a Quaker family on the fringes of London, Lucas began work at the age of sixteen, apprenticed to a bookseller. After that he turned to journalism, and worked on a local paper in Brighton and then on a London evening paper. He was commissioned to write a biography of Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet. This led to further commissions, including the editing of the works of Charles Lamb. Lucas joined the staff of the humorous magazine Punch in 1904, and remained there for the rest of his life. He was a prolific writer, most celebrated for his short essays, but he also produced verses, novels and plays.

Note**‒**taking

It is very essential for everyone to know how to take notes while listening. This is a skill involving listening and writing. Notes are commonly taken during an oral discussion at a meeting, or a lecture (notes of a meeting are usually called **minutes**), in order to keep track of what was said, what happened or what decisions were taken.

As and when your teacher teaches, take notes and jot them down for future reference.

Given below are steps for effective note–taking.

STEP 1: Take and keep notes in a large, loose-leaf notebook; use only one side of the paper.

STEP 2: Sit close to the source, if you can. There are fewer distractions and it is easier to hear, see and attend to important details.

STEP 3: Be selective; don’t try to write down everything you hear, for that is not possible always.

STEP 4:

Write legibly and use abbreviations.

STEP 5: Identify general ideas and listen for cues.

**e Stationmaster’s supreme sacrifice**

**by Sanchari Pal (Adapted)**

hirty-three years ago, on the night ecember 2, 1984, Bhopal was hit by

tastrophe that had no parallel in the ld’s industrial history. An accident he Union Carbide pesticide plant in pal had released almost 30 tons of a ly toxic gas called methyl isocyanate, ing the city into a vast gas chamber. result was a nightmare; more than ,000 people were exposed to the dly gas cloud that left thousands dead many more breathless, blind and in nizing pain. Few people know that ing the Bhopal gas tragedy a heroic ionmaster risked his own life to save rs.

n the evening of December 3, 1984, lam Dastagir was settling down in office to complete some pending

erwork. This work kept him in his office 1am in the night, when he emerged heck the arrival of the Gorakhpur

mbai Express. As he stepped on to platform, the deputy stationmaster his eyes burn and a queer itching ation in his throat. He did not know poisonous fumes leaking from Union bide’s pesticide factory were stealthily eloping the railway station.

eginning to choke, Dastagir did know then that twenty-three of his ay colleagues, including his boss,

ion superintendent Harish Dhurve, already died. It was later reported Dhurve had heard about the deadly and had immediately tried stopping
  

**115**

the movement of trains passing through Bhopal before collapsing in his office chamber. His suddenly worsening health and years of experience told Dastagir that something was very wrong. Though he did not fully comprehend what was happening, he decided to act immediately when he did not get any response from the station master. He alerted the senior staff at nearby stations, like Vidisha and Itarsi, to suspend all train traffic to Bhopal.

4\. However, the jam-packed Gorakhpur- Kanpur Express was already standing at the platform and its departure time was 20 minutes away. Listening to his gut instinct, Dastagir summoned his staff and told them to immediately clear the train for departure. When they asked if they should wait until the order to do so came from the head office, Dastagir replied that he would take complete responsibility for the train’s early departure. He wanted to ensure that the train left immediately, without any delay. His colleagues later recalled that Dastagir could barely stand and breathe as he spoke to them. Breaking all rules and without taking permission from anyone, he and his brave staff personally flagged off the train.

5\. But Dastagir’s work was not done. The railway station was filling up with people, desperate to flee the fumes. Some were gasping, others were vomiting, and most were weeping. Dastagir chose to remain on duty, running from one platform to another, attending, helping and consoling victims. He also sent an SOS to all the nearby railway offices, asking for immediate medical help. As a result, four ambulances with paramedics and railway doctors arrived at the station.

Work with a partner. Read the following questions and share your views with the class. Have you heard of the phrase ‘cat’s paw’? The meaning is similar to that of ‘firing from the other’s shoulder’. ‘Cat’s paw’ refers to a person who is used unwittingly or unwillingly by another person to accomplish his own purpose.

Then he crawled back into the machine again and drew a little black cloth over himself. This time he was very quiet in there. I knew that he was praying and I kept still.

When the photographer came out at last, he looked very **grave** and shook his head.

“The face is quite wrong,” he said.

“I know,” I answered quietly; “I have always known it.”

He sighed.

“I think,” he said, “the face would be better three-quarters full.”

“I’m sure it would,” I said enthusiastically, for I was glad to find that the man had such a human side to him. “So would yours. In fact,” I continued, “how many faces one sees that are apparently hard, narrow, limited, but the minute you get them three-quarters full they get wide, large, almost **boundless** in–”

But the photographer had **ceased** to listen. He came over and took my head in his hands and twisted it sideways. I thought he meant to kiss me, and I closed my eyes.

But I was wrong.

Snick!

The photographer had pulled a string. The photograph was taken. I could see the machine still **staggering** from the shock.

“I think,” said the photographer, pursing his lips in a pleased smile, “that I caught the features just in a moment of **animation**.”

“So!” I said bitingly,– “features, eh? You didn’t think I could animate them, I suppose? But let me see the picture.”

“Oh, there’s nothing to see yet,” he said, “I have to develop the negative first. Come back on Saturday and I’ll let you see a proof of it.”

On Saturday I went back.

The photographer beckoned me in. I thought he seemed quieter and graver than before. I think, too, there was a certain pride in his manner.

He unfolded the proof of a large photograph, and we both looked at it in silence.

“Is it me?” I asked.

“Yes,” he said quietly, “it is you,” and we went on looking at it.

“The eyes,” I said hesitatingly, “don’t look very much like mine.”

“Oh, no,” he answered, “I’ve retouched them. They come out splendidly, don’t they?”

Take your negative, or whatever it is you call it–dip it in sulphide, bromide, oxide, cowhide–anything you like–remove the eyes, correct the mouth, adjust the face, restore the lips, reanimate the necktie and reconstruct the waistcoat. Coat it with an inch of gloss, shade it, **emboss** it, gild it, till even you acknowledge that it is finished. Then when you have done all that–keep it for yourself and your friends. They may value it. To me it is but a worthless **bauble.**” I broke into tears and left.

D. Discuss this aspect with your partner and share your views on how students can give back to society.

**E. Introduction**

**What goes around comes around!**

Every activity in a society, be it development of infrastructure, education, health care etc. demands resources of all kinds. Resources can be mobilized only through human efforts. This effort comes from many different sections of society. Thus, the fruits of development we enjoy today have come about only through the hardwork of many unsung heroes.

It is our duty to contribute to development by giving back what we have taken. When a qualified student embarks on his/her career, an element of service should always be a part of motivation. The society has cradled and nurtured every graduate to bloom and spread his/her wings. Graduation is the apt time to give back to society the gains we have obtained.

**Read an excerpt from the famous address**

**made by the great leader Arignar Anna,**

**at the Annamalai University, Tamil**

**Nadu, on November 18, 1967, on the**

**occasion of Convocation.**

Thankful as I am for the unique honour **conferred** on me by this institution. I stand before this august assembly today to deliver the Convocation address, for though it is a pleasure to be present on the happy occasion of greeting the graduates of the year and wishing them all a bright and prosperous future, it is not an easy task to place appropriate guidelines before them.

to play and the prominence is growing every day, as more and more individuals get themselves equipped for the task of bettering society in all its age when we have **eschewed** monarchy and **autocracy** and have inaugurated the era of democracy.

During the monarchical or **feudal** days, Universities had to train scholars and poets to adorn the chambers of royalty or the gilded mansions of lords and nobles and their wisdom was meant for the mansion, not for the market place. Those were days when numbers did not count, nor were eminent scholars asked to face the problems **confronting** the masses. They were content to work in **secluded**

**spheres**, far from the din and noise of the common man and weave the costly fabric of philosophy of poetry which in turn was to be converted into dazzling garments for the select and the privileged.

The role of the University today is not cloistered and confined as in the past. Its function has been enlarged\_not in its fundamentals but in its domain. It has to take into account the commonness, but trim and train, guide and lead him, before being asked to do his duty as the citizen of a democracy – a task which kindles sweet hopes but which demands patience and **perseverance, faith and confidence, faith** in himself and in others and confidence in his **inherent** ability to shoulder the responsibilities. The common man has become the origin of a potential ruler and the duty today, the responsibility today of the universities is to fashion out of him an individual fitted and equipped for the task of making democracy fruitful and effective.

While addressing the University russels, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, our er President, made the following

ement: “For its proper functioning ocracy requires more qualities than r forms of government. It is in the ersities that we can develop the spirit of democracy, appreciation thers’ points of view and adjustment differences through discussions. It be kept healthy and strong by the cise of individual responsibility and ement. In universities we have to ll the struggles of the past and realize perils and possibilities, the challenges opportunities, of the present.”

**r better understanding:**

cording to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan iversities ensure the democratic way life for the future generations. How?

Graduates of the year, I wish you prosperous future – for, after all, the ediate concern of every individual, uate or no graduate, is to acquire the ns for a decent living. That is the first ivation for all human activity and no one ignore it, but that ought not to be the objective. Something higher and nobler mere individual material advancement pected of you – for remember that this

versity education is a privilege that you y, for which you are deeply **indebted** to community of which you are a member.

**r better understanding:**

w can a University trim and train, ide and lead a person to function tter in society?
  

**141**

Most of the money needed for maintaining institutions of higher education come from the revenues collected from the community through the State, and a good proportion of that revenue comes from the **tillers** and the **toilers**, men who did not enjoy this privilege, men who willingly submit themselves to discomfort, so that they can enable the next generation to lead a better life. Graduates, may I ask you, how are you going to repay – what is to be your contribution to the social chest on which you have drawn so largely. Unless you **replenish** it richly, coming generations will find only an empty coffer.

**For better understanding:**

List the contributions of the educated youth to the society.

Your superior education increases your responsibility to society and therefore, apart from or along with your own individual advancement, society has got a right to expect an adequate return from you – not so much in terms of money as in terms of service – in toning up society, in bringing light into the dark alleys, sunshine into dingy places, solace into the afflicted, hope unto the **despondent** and a new life unto every one.

Unless service is the outcome, the **sermons** become sweet nothings. As Jefferson stated, “We must dream of an aristocracy of achievements arising out of a democracy of opportunities.”

**About the Author**

**Dr. Conjeevaram Natarajan**

**Annadurai** (15 September 1909 – 3 February 1969), popularly called Arignar Anna was an Indian politician who served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (1967 – 69). He was a great orator and an acclaimed writer in Tamil. Jawaharlal Nehru hailed him as one of the greatest parliamentarians. He has published several novels, short stories and plays which incorporate political and social themes. C.N. Annadurai was awarded the Chubb Fellowship at Yale University, the first non-American to receive this honour. The same year he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Annamalai University.

The Purananuru song conveys the philosophy of Tamilians. It celebrates the selfless spirit and courage of people who served society by sharing everything with their fellowmen, even something as precious and unique as the nectar of immortality. They would never do a wrong deed even if they were offered the world as a reward. It is because of such men that the world continues to exist.

**Have you heard of Open Letters?**

An **open letter** is a letter that is intended to be read by a wide audience, or a letter intended for an individual, but that is nonetheless widely distributed intentionally through newspapers and other media, such as a letter to the editor or a blog.

Sociologists, scholars, anthropologists and historians have written open letters. Letters patent are another form of open letter in which a legal document is both mailed to a person by the government and publicized so that all are made aware of it. Open letters can also be addressed directly to a group rather than any individual.

Reading such letters will also help to improve your vocabulary. Here are some easy ways to improve and expand your vocabulary.

Gandhi Letter 23A: From Rabindranath Tagore

Shanti Niketan,

April 12, 1919.

Dear Mahatmaji,

Power in all its forms is irrational — it is like the horse that drags the carriage blindfolded. The moral element in it is only represented in the man who drives the horse. Passive resistance, a force which is not necessarily moral in itself, can be used against truth as well as for it. The danger inherent in all force grows stronger when it is likely to gain success, for then it becomes temptation. I know your teaching is to fight against evil by the help of the good. But such a fight is for heroes and not for men led by impulses of the moment. Evil on one side naturally begets evil on the other, injustice leading to violence and insult to vengefulness. Unfortunately, such a force has already been started, and either through panic or through wrath our authorities have shown us the claws whose sure effect is to drive some of us into the secret path of resentment and others into utter demoralization. In this crisis you, as a great leader of men, have stood among us to proclaim your faith in the ideal which you know to be that of India, the ideal which is both against the cowardliness of hidden revenge and the cowed submissiveness of the terror- stricken...

I have always felt, and said accordingly, that the great gift of freedom can never come to a people through charity. We must win it before we can own it. And India’s opportunity for winning it will

e to her when she can prove that she orally superior to the people who rule by their right of conquest. Armed with utter faith in goodness she must stand bashed before the arrogance that scoffs e power of spirit. And you have come

our motherland in the time of her need emind her of her mission, to lead her he true path of conquest, to purge her ent day politics of its feebleness which gines that it has gained its purpose n it struts in the borrowed feathers of omatic dishonesty. This is why I pray t fervently that nothing that tends to ken our spiritual freedom may intrude your marching line, that martyrdom he cause of truth may never degenerate fanaticism for mere verbal forms, ending into the self-deception that s itself behind sacred names.

h these few words for an introduction w me to offer the following as a poet’s tribution to your noble work:

e me the supreme courage of love, is my prayer, courage to speak, o, to suffer at thy will, ave all things or be left alone.

e me the supreme faith of love, is my prayer, faith of the life in death, e victory in defeat, e power hidden in the frailness of

beauty, e dignity of pain that accepts hurt,

disdains to return it.

Very sincerely yours, Rabindranath Tagore

B. Virat Kohli, the Man of the match and Man of the Series in the one–day International series between India and South Africa February 2018 had this to say during the post match presentation. India won the match by 8 wickets and won the series by 5 – 1, a historic win against South Africa in their home soil.

**Rewrite his words in Reported Speech.**

“It was a day I felt really good. Last game, I was not in the right kind of mindset. This is a beautiful place to bat under lights. That’s the idea behind bowling first. I like setting up for the short ball. It was a blessing in disguise, and they kept bowling short. I think the pitch got better to bat on under lights. It has been a roller coaster till now. People who are close to me deserve a lot of credit. Obviously, you want to lead from the front, and that’s a wonderful feeling. I have got eight or nine years left in my career and I want to make the most of every day. It’s a blessing that I am healthy and getting to captain my country. They have shown great character – especially the two young spinners. The way the series went augurs well for us. We’re looking forward to the T20s. The tour is not over yet. After losing the Test series, I was talking to you. I am here talking to you after winning the ODI series.”

C. Read the given passages and rewrite them in direct speech.

We are proud and feel so tall, Our **virtues** though be few and small Our nature it is that whatever we try We do with **devotion** deep and true.

Defeat we **repel**, courage our fort; **Cringing** from others we haven’t done, To seek a gain we **adore** none: We are proud and feel so tall.

We deem it our duty and mission in life, To bless and praise the deserving ones; Never shall we fail in what we commit, Shall nourish the ones that **nourish** the world

We are proud of the position we Hold; humble as we are, Our pride springs from the way we live. Ours is a path of dignity and honour, A life that knows no kneeling and bending. We are proud and feel so tall.

Everest is not the only peak, Every hillock has a **summit** to boast! The height you reach is not that we care; He, who does not **stoop**, is a king we adore. We bow before **competence** and **merit**; The ones that are true and stand on their own Are really the ladder for the rise of Man. Honour is a property, common to all: In dignity and pride no one need to be poor. We are proud and feel so tall.

With despair – cold, sharp despair – buried deep in her heart like a wicked knife, Miss Meadows, in cap and gown and carrying a little **baton**, trod the cold corridors that led to the music hall. Girls of all ages, rosy from the air, and bubbling over with that gleeful excitement that comes from running to school on a fine autumn morning, hurried, skipped, fluttered by; from the hollow classrooms came a quick drumming of voices; a bell rang; a voice like a bird cried, "Muriel."

**161**

"You look frozen," said she. Her blue

eyes opened wide; there came a mocking

light in them. (Had she noticed anything?)

"Oh, not quite as bad as that," said

Miss Meadows, and she gave the Science

Mistress, in exchange for her smile, a

quick **grimace** and passed on.

Forms Four, Five, and Six were

assembled in the music hall. The noise was

deafening. On the platform, by the piano,

stood Mary Beazley, Miss Meadowsʹ

favourite, who played **accompaniments**.

She was turning the music stool. When

she saw Miss Meadows she gave a loud,

warning "Sh-sh! Girls!" and Miss Meadows,

her hands thrust in her sleeves, the baton

under her arm, strode down the centre

aisle, mounted the steps, turned sharply,

seized the brass music stand, planted it in

front of her, and gave two sharp taps with

her baton for silence.

"Silence, please! Immediately!" and,

looking at nobody, her glance swept over

that sea of coloured flannel blouses, with

bobbing pink faces and hands, quivering

butterfly hair-bows, and music-books

outspread. She knew perfectly well

what they were thinking. "Meady is in a

wax." Well, let them think it! Her eyelids

quivered; she tossed her head, defying

them. What could the thoughts of those

creatures matter to someone who stood

there bleeding to death, pierced to the

heart, by such a letter —

— "I feel more and more strongly that our

marriage would be a mistake. Not that

truth to tell, I have come to the

clusion that I am not a marrying man,

tched out lightly and "regret" written

the top.

Basil! Miss Meadows stalked over

he piano. And Mary Beazley, who was

ing for this moment, bent forward;

curls fell over her cheeks while she

thed, "Good morning, Miss Meadows,"

she motioned towards rather than

ded to her mistress a beautiful yellow

santhemum. This little ritual of the

er had been gone through for ages

ages, quite a term and a half. It was

uch part of the lesson as opening

piano. But this morning, instead of

ng it up, instead of tucking it into her

while she leant over Mary and said,

ank you, Mary. How very nice! Turn to

e thirty-two," what was Mary's horror

n Miss Meadows totally ignored the

santhemum, made no reply to her

ting, but said in a voice of ice, "Page

teen, please, and mark the accents

."

Staggering moment! Mary blushed

l the tears stood in her eyes, but Miss

dows was gone back to the music

d; her voice rang through the music

.

"Page fourteen. We will begin with

e fourteen. 'A Lament.' Now, girls,

ought to know it by this time. We

l take it all together; not in parts, all

ther. And without expression. Sing it,

gh, quite simply, beating time with

left hand."
  

**162**

She raised the baton; she tapped the

music stand twice. Down came Mary on

the opening chord; down came all those

left hands, beating the air, and in chimed

those young, mournful voices:- "Fast! Ah,

too Fast Fade the Ro-o-ses of Pleasure;

Soon Autumn yields unto Wi-i-nter

Drear. Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly Mu-u-sic's Gay

Measure Passes away from the Listening

Ear."

Good Heavens, what could be more

tragic than that lament! Every note was a

sigh, a sob, a groan of awful mournfulness.

Miss Meadows lifted her arms in the wide

gown and began conducting with both

hands. "—I feel more and more strongly

that our marriage would be a mistake —"

she beat. And the voices cried: "Fleetly!

Ah, Fleetly." What could have possessed

him to write such a letter! What could have

led up to it! It came out of nothing. His

last letter had been all about a fumed-oak

bookcase he had bought for "our" books,

and a "natty little hall-stand" he had seen,

"a very neat affair with a carved owl on

a bracket, holding three hat-brushes in

its claws." How she had smiled at that! So

like a man to think one needed three hat-

brushes! "From the Listening Ear," sang

the voices.

 "Once again," said Miss Meadows. "But

this time in parts. Still without expression."

"Fast! Ah, too Fast." With the gloom of the

**contraltos** added, one could scarcely help

shuddering. "Fade the Roses of Pleasure."

Last time he had come to see her, Basil

had worn a rose in his buttonhole. How

handsome he had looked in that bright blue

suit, with that dark red rose! And he knew

it, too. He couldn't help knowing it. First

Again the two light taps; she lifted

her arms again. "Fast! Ah, too Fast." —

and the idea of settling down fills me with

nothing but disgust—" Disgust was what

he had written. That was as good as to say

their engagement was definitely broken

off. Broken off ! Their engagement! People

had been surprised enough that she had

got engaged. The Science Mistress would

not believe it at first. But nobody had been

as surprised as she. She was thirty. Basil

was twenty-five. It had been a miracle,

simply a miracle, to hear him say, as they

walked home from church that very dark

night, "You know, somehow or other, I've

got fond of you." And he had taken hold of

the end of her ostrich feather boa. "Passes

away from the Listening Ear."

"Repeat! Repeat!" said Miss Meadows.

"More expression, girls! Once more!"

"Fast! Ah, too Fast." The older girls

were crimson; some of the younger ones

began to cry. Big spots of rain blew against

the windows, and one could hear the

willows whispering, "— not that I do not

love you— "

"But, my darling, if you love me,"

thought Miss Meadows, "I don't mind

how much it is. Love me as little as you

like." But she knew he didn't love her. Not

to have cared enough to scratch out that

word "disgust," so that she couldn't read it!

"Soon Autumn yields unto Winter Drear."

She would have to leave the school, too.

"Very well," said Miss Meadows. And

called to the girls, "I shall put you on

The corridors were silent and cold;

"Pay no attention to letter, must have

she read. She couldn't take her eyes off the

telegram.

"I do hope it's nothing very serious," said

Miss Wyatt, leaning forward.

"Oh, no, thank you, Miss Wyatt,"

blushed Miss Meadows. "It's nothing bad

at all. It's" – and she gave an apologetic

little laugh – "it's from my **fiance** saying

that – saying that –" There was a pause. "I

see," said Miss Wyatt. And another pause.

Then, "You've fifteen minutes more of

your class, Miss Meadows, haven't you?"

"Yes, Miss Wyatt." She got up. She half ran

towards the door.

"Oh, just one minute, Miss Meadows,"

said Miss Wyatt. "I must say I don't approve

of my teachers having telegrams sent to

them in school hours, unless in case of

very bad news, such as death," explained

Miss Wyatt, "or a very serious accident, or

something to that effect. Good news, Miss

Meadows, will always keep, you know."

On the wings of hope, of love, of joy,

Miss Meadows sped back to the music

hall, up the aisle, up the steps, over to the

piano.

"Page thirty-two, Mary," she said,

"page thirty-two," and, picking up the

yellow chrysanthemum, she held it to her

lips to hide her smile. Then she turned

to the girls, rapped with her baton: "Page

thirty-two, girls. Page thirty-two."

**Warm Up**

Often on formal occasions, we admire friends and strangers who appear elegant, who are pleasant to converse with and who conduct themselves gracefully. At times, we also see people who are awkward, nervous and doubtful about their next move.

Recall a few examples of awkward actions that can cause discomfort or disturbance to others like spilling a cup of hot drink on someone nearby.

**frustrations of a globetrotter and find**

**out how he faces chaos in his everyday**

**life.**

Of all the things I am not very good at, living in the real world is perhaps the most outstanding. I am constantly filled with wonder at the number of things that other people do without any evident difficulty that are pretty much beyond me. I cannot tell you the number of times that I have gone looking for the lavatory

cinema, for instance, and ended up ding in an **alley** on the wrong side a self-locking door. My particular ialty now is returning to hotel desks

or three times a day and asking what room number is. I am, in short, easily fused.

I was thinking about this the last time went en famille on a big trip. It was aster, and we were flying to England a week. When we arrived at Logan ort in Boston and were checking in, I

denly remembered that I had recently ed British Airways’ frequent flyer ramme. I also remembered that I

put the card in the carry-on bag that hanging around my neck. And here’s re the trouble started.

**dental Tourist**

Prose

**Bill Bryson**
  

**169**

The zip on the bag was jammed. So I pulled on it and **yanked** at it, with grunts and frowns and increasing **consternation**. I kept this up for some minutes but it wouldn’t budge, so I pulled harder and harder, with more grunts. Well, you can guess what happened. Abruptly the zip gave way. The side of the bag flew open and everything within — newspaper cuttings and other loose papers, a 14- ounce tin of pipe tobacco, magazines, passport, English money, film — was **extravagantly** ejected over an area about the size of a tennis court.

I watched dumbstruck as a hundred carefully sorted documents came raining down in a fluttery **cascade**, coins bounced to a variety of noisy oblivions and the now- lidless tin of tobacco rolled crazily across the **concourse** disgorging its contents as it went.

“My tobacco!” I cried in horror, thinking what I would have to pay for that much tobacco in England now that another Budget had come and gone, and then changed the cry to “My finger! My finger!” as I discovered that I had **gashed** my finger on the zip and was shedding blood in a lavish manner. (I am not very good around flowing blood generally, but when it’s my own — well, I think **hysterics**

are to h

look — sim you

fully justified.) Confused and unable elp, my hair went into panic mode.

It was at this point that my wife ed at me with an expression of wonder

not anger or **exasperation,** but just ple wonder — and said, “I can’t believe do this for a living.”

But I’m afraid it’s so. I always have **strophes** when I travel. Once on an plane, I leaned over to tie a shoelace

at the moment someone in the seat ad of me threw his seat back into

recline, and found myself pinned lessly in the crash position. It was only lawing the leg of the man sitting next e that I managed to get myself freed.

This, however, was not my worst rience on a plane flight. My worst rience was when I was writing important ghts in a notebook (‘buy socks’, ‘clutch ks carefully’, etc.), sucking thoughtfully he end of my pen as you do, and fell into versation with an attractive young lady he next seat. I amused her for perhaps

inutes with a scattering of urbane bons s, then retired to the lavatory where I overed that the pen had leaked and that mouth, chin, tongue, teeth and gums

e now a striking, scrub-resistant navy , and would remain so for several days.
  

**170**

So you will understand, I trust, when

I tell you how much I ache to be **suave**. I

would love, just once in my life, to rise from a

dinner table without looking as if I have just

experienced an extremely localised seismic

event, get in a car and close the door without

leaving 14 inches of coat outside, wear light-

coloured trousers without discovering at the

end of the day that I have at various times

sat on chewing gum, ice cream, cough syrup

and motor oil. But it is not to be.

Now on planes when the food is

delivered, my wife says: “Take the lids off

the food for Daddy” or “Put your hoods up,

children. Daddy’s about to cut his meat.”

Of course, this is only when I am fl ying

with my family. When I am on my own,

I don’t eat, drink or lean over to tie my

shoelaces, and never put a pen anywhere

near my mouth. I just sit very, very quietly,

sometimes on my hands to keep them from

fl ying out unexpectedly and causing liquid

mischief. It’s not much fun, but it does at

least cut down on the laundry bills.

I never did get my frequent fl yer miles,

by the way. I never do. I couldn’t fi nd the card

in time. Th is has become a real frustration for

me. Everyone I know — everyone — is for

ever fl ying off to Bali fi rst class with their air

miles. I never get to collect anything. I must fl y

100,000 miles a year, yet I have accumulated

only about 212 air miles divided between

twenty-three airlines.

**Speaking Activity**
  

**174**

Do you know the difference between

transcription and translation?

Transcription is the process of listening to

an audio file and writing what has been

said verbatim in the same language that

the original speaker used.

Translation is the process of expressing the

sense of a written text to another language

i.e. converting from one language to

another without changing the meaning.

The ability to translate is both a skill and

an art. Translation can be done from the

language being learned (here it is English)

into the mother tongue or from the mother

tongue into English.

Have you ever heard of the term

transliteration?

Transliteration gives the word from a

different language in letters that you

can read so as to be able to pronounce it

properly.

e.g. Vanakkam for tzf;fk; ( Tamil)

**Narration**

Narration is a recital of events, especially in

chronological order, as the story narrated

in a poem or the exposition in a drama.

The narrative form is the most common

mode of writing. Even news is narrated as

and interesting.

**rative Writing**

re are many ways of expressing our ghts and ideas in an. interesting ner. One way is to present them as a ation. In this section we shall learn to develop a proverb and a news

dline into a story paragraph.

y story has a beginning, middle and an ing. Here is the format for developing a y:

**oduction / Beginning**

escribe the setting ( where?, when?) ntroduce the characters ( who?) xplain the situation.

**nts / Middle**

escribe what happened. se transition words that show time

nd order ( suddenly, as soon as, before, eanwhile)

**tion / Ending**

xplain how the story ends escribe what happens to the characters.

tate how the problem ends / gets esolved dd a reflection sentence or a closing

entence.

**example: Expand the Proverb ‘A bad kman always blames his tools’** **into a**

**y-paragraph. Notice the beginning,**

**dle and the ending. Begin with the**

**ning of the proverb.**

**ad workman always blames his tools’.**

meaning of this proverb is that our ess does not depend on what kind of s we have but how we use them. Here story to elucidate the meaning.

**Writing**
  

**177**

Raj and Ravi were farmers. They owned a pair of oxen each with which they ploughed their lands. Raj put in hard work while Ravi hardly worked. Raj worked all day long, aimed at getting a good yield and took good care of his oxen, fully understanding their needs. Ravi, on the other hand, was very lazy and miserly. He never fed his oxen well but exploited them to the maximum.

As a true friend, Raj advised Ravi and sometimes even admonished him for his treatment of the animals. Ravi paid little heed to Raj’s words. He soon bought a tractor to plough his land and chased the oxen away. Raj brought home the animals and took care of them too though he could not afford it. The monsoon soon arrived and it was time for cultivation. Raj’s land was well-ploughed and ready for cultivation - thanks to his oxen.

Ravi in his miserly fashion had not maintained his tractor well and it kept giving him trouble. As a result, he could not get his field ready for cultivation on time. He lamented and blamed it all on bad luck not realizing that it was he who was responsible for his miserable state. Ravi not only lost out on a good yield because of his laziness, but also spent a huge sum of money to repair his tractor due to poor maintenance. Despite having better equipment, Ravi was unable to get the best results. But, Raj was a good workman and hence was able to succeed with the limited resources he had.

Now write a short story to explain these proverbs.

1\. Actions speak louder than words. 2. Despair gives courage to a coward.

**b. The historical background:**

The poem is an extract from William

Shakespeare’s play **King Richard the**

**Second**. The play is based on true events

that occurred towards the end of the 14th

century.

Richard II was crowned the King of

England in the year 1367. He continued to

be the British Monarch until 1399, when

he was deposed by his cousin, Henry

of Bolingbroke, who crowned himself

King Henry the Fourth in the same year.

Shakespeare’s play is a dramatic rendition

of the last two years of King Richard II’s

life. In this brief span of time, he was

ousted from his royal position and sent to

prison, where he died in captivity.

Save our **deposed** bodies to the ground? Our lands, our lives, and all, are Bolingbroke’s, And nothing can we call our own but death; And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones. For God’s sake let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings: How some have been depos’d, some **slain** in war, Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed**,**

Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping kill’d, All murdered – for within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court, and there the **antic** sits, **Scoffing** his state and **grinning** at his pomp, Allowing him a breath, a little scene, To **monarchize,** be fear’d, and kill with looks; Infusing him with self and vain conceit, As if this flesh which walls about our life Were brass **impregnable**; and, humour’d thus, Comes at the last, and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king! Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence; throw away respect, Tradition, form, and **ceremonious** duty; For you have but mistook me all this while. I live with bread like you, feel want, Taste grief, need friends – subjected thus, How can you say to me, I am a king?

A. Fill in the blanks using the words given in the box to complete the summary of the poem:

King Richard the second had surrendered to his (a)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cousin, Bollingbroke. He experienced deep distress at the horror of his circumstances. In that desperate situation, he speaks of (b)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, (c)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, (d)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and other things connected with death. He spoke of how people leave nothing behind and can call nothing their own, except for the small patch of (e)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, where they will be buried. King Richard yielded to dejection and talked of all the different ways in which defeated kings suffer how some had been deposed, (f )\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in war, (g)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by their wives and so forth. He attributed this loss of lives to (h)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, who he personified as the jester who watches over the shoulder of every ruler, who mocks kings by allowing them to think their human flesh, was like (i)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_brass. However, Death penetrates through the castle walls, silently and unnoticed like a sharp (j)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, thus bidding (k)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to him and all his pride forever. Finally, Richard appealed to his soldiers not to mock his mere flesh and blood by showing (l) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and respect to him. He added that he too needed bread to live, felt want, tasted (m)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and needed (n)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. He concluded thus, urging his men not to call him a (o)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as he was only human, just like the rest of them.

**Jill:** And this is the lounge.

Why, yes; you just pay ten pounds and it’s yours.

**Jack:**

You see, Aunt Jane, we realized how uneconomic it is to go on paying rent year after year, when you can buy and enjoy a home of your own for ten pounds—and a few quarterly payments, of course. Why be Mr .Tenant when you can be Mr. Owner?

**Aunt Jane:**

I see. Yes, there’s something in that. Even so, you must be getting on very well to keep up a place like this.

**Jack:**

As a matter of fact—er—that is—six pounds.

**Aunt Jane:**

But that’s **absurd**! How can you pay seven pounds eight and eight pence out of six pounds?

**Jack:**

Oh, that’s easy. You see, all you have to do is to borrow the rest of the money for the payments from the Thrift and Providence Trust Corporation.

**Listening Activity**

**Unit - 1 (Prose)**

The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. It is the mother who rocks the cradle. It is she who exercises her influence over the mind of her children. She moulds the character of her children with her noble qualities. Napoleon said, “Give me good mothers, I will give you a good nation.” Mothers play an important role in building nations. The love of our mother is usually the first and deepest love that we come across. For many people their mother’s love becomes the pattern of love in later life.

A mother’s love is unconditional. No matter what you do, you know that your mother will always love you. The phrase ‘mother’s love’ derives from the love traditionally shown by a biological mother to her child. But indeed any love that is deeply caring and unconditional can be described as a motherly love. Adoptive mothers show this type of love to the children they adopt. It is important in life to be cherished and loved for who you are and to be supported in all you do. Love is the most important thing in the world. Why not exhibit love to creatures and all those around you?

**Unit - 1 (Poem)**

**Father by Edgar Albert Guest**

My father knows the proper way The nation should be run;

He tells us children every day Just what should now be done.

He knows the way to fix the trusts,

“

4 Yuv poin for the run SIX nati Wh can Sach and in M ball of s  

He has a simple plan; But if the furnace needs repairs,

We have to hire a man.

My father, in a day or two Could land big thieves in jail;

There’s nothing that he cannot do, He knows no word like “fail.”

Our confidence” he would restore, Of that there is no doubt;

But if there is a chair to mend, We have to send it out.

In conversation father can Do many wondrous things; He’s built upon a wiser plan

Than presidents or kings. He knows the ins and outs of each

And every deep transaction; We look to him for theories,

But look to ma for action.

Kookaburra soared over the fence. Bhajji too is in tears. 28 years in waiting and the helicopter shot has brought an end to the game.

The finishers of old times Dhoni and Yuvraj, who were popularly called 'The Finishers' against Pakistan and Sri Lanka a few years ago, took the game closer and a thrilling finish was on the cards. They needed 30 off 30 deliveries when the batting power play became mandatory. Could they do it? They were up against a lethal bowler in Malinga. Just three runs of the Malinga over meant the Indians needed 27 off the next four overs. There were nerves all around, but the two batsmen in the middle looked to be in a different world altogether. Pressure was just a distant relative and they kept their cool to help India romp home with 10 deliveries to spare.

**“To Autumn” by William Blake (1783**)

O Autumn, laden with fruit, and stain’d With the blood of the grape, pass not, but

sit Beneath my shady roof; there thou may’st

rest, And tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe, And all the daughters of the year shall

dance! Sing now the lusty song of fruits and

flowers.

“The narrow bud opens her beauties to The sun, and love runs in her thrilling

veins; Blossoms hang round the brows of

Morning, and Flourish down the bright cheek of

modest Eve, Till clust’ring Summer breaks forth into

singing, And feather’d clouds strew flowers round

her head.

The spirits of the air live in the smells Of fruit; and joy, with pinions light, roves

round The gardens, or sits singing in the trees.” Thus sang the jolly Autumn as he sat, Then rose, girded himself, and o’er the

bleak Hills fled from our sight; but left his

golden load.
