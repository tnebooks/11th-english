Man 6: Almost eight-thirty. The dentist should be along any moment now.

Woman 6: Isn’t it a **dreadful** hour of the morning to see a Dentist! I’m not half awake yet.

Man 5: I hope he won’t be long. I’m going to be late for work anyway.

Man 6: Something should be done about dental hours. I’ve always said so and I’ll go on saying so.

**_(Enter Nurse.)_**

Woman 6: Good, the dentist shouldn’t be long now.

Woman 5: And this is one of the boarding houses at Waddling-on-sea. Our boarding house. Those are the steps I fell up. We nearly died laughing.

Man 1: I will.

Woman 1: Good-bye, Joe, I’ll wait for you.

**_(Exit Man 1 into surgery. Woman 1 sits.)_**

Woman 2: I believe the Dentist is ever so good.

Woman 3: Yes, he took out six for Mrs. Johnstone, and she never felt a thing.

**_(Enter Woman 8 with the Small Boy.)_**

Woman 8: Now Maurice, there’s nothing to be afraid of.

Small Boy: I’m not afraid.

Woman 8 Just a little pull, and ever such a **weeny**

**tug**, and all the pain will be gone.

Small Boy: There is no need to treat me like a baby. I’m not afraid of a dentist.

Woman 8: Now sit down quietly, Maurice, and I’m sure the nice dentist won’t be long.

Man 6: Well, if it wasn’t a hammer, I should be attending an eye specialist and not a dentist.

Woman 5: I hope he isn’t going to use it.

Man 3: It’s a peculiar thing to have in a surgery.

Woman 1: His cabinet?

Man 1: Yes, you see he lost the key.

Woman 1: So he hasn’t done anything to you, Joe!

Man 1: Not a thing, and I can’t wait any longer this morning. I’ve made an appointment with him for this evening instead. The nurse gave me some pills to deaden the pain in the meantime.

**In ‘Tight Corners’, E.V. Lucas narrates**

**the story of how he was rescued from**

**humiliation at an auction house, by a**

**sudden stroke of luck. Let’s read on and**

**get to know how he got himself in a tight**

**corner and found his way out of that**

**situation.**

The talk was running on the critical situations in which we had found ourselves — those of us whose lives were adventurous enough to comprise any.

One man had been caught by the tide in **Brittany** and escaped by the skin of his teeth. Another had been on an elephant when a wounded tiger charged at it. A third had been on the top storey of a burning house. A fourth was torpedoed in the War.

“But you all talk,” said one of the company, “as though tight corners were always physical affairs. Surely they can be tighter when they are mental. The tightest comer I was ever in was at Christie’s.”

“Christie’s?”

“Yes. I had been lunching rather well at a club in **St. James’s Street** with an old friend from abroad, and passing along **King Street** afterwards, he persuaded me to look in at the sale-room. The place was full.

) Describe the activity that was going on in the sale-room at King Street.

) What can you say about the author’s attitude when he high-handedly participated in the auction?

You’ll get caught,’ my friend said to me.

No, I shan’t,” I said. “I’m not going o run any risks.”

) Why was the author sure he would not be caught?

) What made the author ignore his friend’s warning?

“And for a long time I didn’t. And then cture was put up and a short red- faced in a new top-hat — some well-known

ler — who had bought quite a number, **trified** the room by starting the ing at a figure a little higher than any

he had yet given or that anything had hed.
  

**106**

Although the previous lots had run into four figures they had all been modestly started at fifty guineas or a hundred guineas, with a gradual **crescendo** to which I had often been safely contributing. But no sooner was the new picture displayed than the dealer made his sensational bid, “Four thousand guineas,” he said.

e) How had the author managed the auction without getting involved in the deal?

There was a rustle of excitement, and at the end of it I heard my own voice saying, “And fifty!” A terrible silence followed, during which the auctioneer looked inquiringly first at the opener and then at the company generally.

To my surprise and horror the red- faced dealer gave no sign of life. I realized now, as I ought to have done at first, that he had shot his bolt.

f ) What came as a shock to the author?

“Four thousand and fifty guineas offered”, said the auctioneer, again searching the room.

My heart stopped; my blood **congealed**. There was no sound but a curious **smothered** noise from my friend.

Four thousand and fifty guineas. Any advance on four thousand and fifty guineas? — and the hammer fell.

g) What did the falling of the hammer indicate?

I was running over the names of les and other persons from whom it ht be possible to borrow, but wasn’t; dering if the moneylenders who talk **libly** about ‘**note of hand** only’ really n it; speculating on the possibility of fessing my poverty to one of Christie’s and having the picture put up again. t was the best way — and yet how ld I do it after all the other bids I had e? The staff looked so prosperous and

ympathetic, and no one would believe as a mistake. A genuine mistake of such nd would have been rectified at once.

) What kind of excuses did the narrator think he could make?
  

**107**

Meanwhile the sale came to an end and I stood on the outskirts of the little knot of buyers round the desk who were writing cheques and giving instructions. Naturally I preferred to be the last. It was there that I was joined by my friend; but only for a moment, for on a look at my face he rammed his handkerchief in his mouth and again disappeared. Alone I was to \***dree this awful weird.** I have never felt such a fool or had colder feet in all my life. I believe I should have welcomed a firing party.

j) Why did the friend desert the narrator, a second time?

And then the unexpected happened, and I realized that a career of **rectitude** sometimes has rewards beyond the mere consciousness of virtue. A voice at my ear suddenly said, ‘Beg pardon. Sir, but was you the gent that bought the big Daubigny?”

I admitted it.

“Well, the gent who offered four thousand guineas wants to know if you’ll take fifty guineas for your bid.”

If ever a messenger of the high gods wore a green **baize** apron and spoke in husky Cockney tones this was he. I could have embraced him and wept for joy. Would I take fifty guineas. Why, I would have taken fifty **farthings.**

How does the Narrator show presence of mind in the sudden turn of events?

**About the Author**

Edward Verrall Lucas, (1868 – 1938) was an English humourist, essayist, playwright, biographer, publisher, poet, novelist, short story writer and editor. Born to a Quaker family on the fringes of London, Lucas began work at the age of sixteen, apprenticed to a bookseller. After that he turned to journalism, and worked on a local paper in Brighton and then on a London evening paper. He was commissioned to write a biography of Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet. This led to further commissions, including the editing of the works of Charles Lamb. Lucas joined the staff of the humorous magazine Punch in 1904, and remained there for the rest of his life. He was a prolific writer, most celebrated for his short essays, but he also produced verses, novels and plays.

Note**‒**taking

It is very essential for everyone to know how to take notes while listening. This is a skill involving listening and writing. Notes are commonly taken during an oral discussion at a meeting, or a lecture (notes of a meeting are usually called **minutes**), in order to keep track of what was said, what happened or what decisions were taken.

As and when your teacher teaches, take notes and jot them down for future reference.

Given below are steps for effective note–taking.

STEP 1: Take and keep notes in a large, loose-leaf notebook; use only one side of the paper.

STEP 2: Sit close to the source, if you can. There are fewer distractions and it is easier to hear, see and attend to important details.

STEP 3: Be selective; don’t try to write down everything you hear, for that is not possible always.

STEP 4:

Write legibly and use abbreviations.

STEP 5: Identify general ideas and listen for cues.

**e Stationmaster’s supreme sacrifice**

**by Sanchari Pal (Adapted)**

hirty-three years ago, on the night ecember 2, 1984, Bhopal was hit by

tastrophe that had no parallel in the ld’s industrial history. An accident he Union Carbide pesticide plant in pal had released almost 30 tons of a ly toxic gas called methyl isocyanate, ing the city into a vast gas chamber. result was a nightmare; more than ,000 people were exposed to the dly gas cloud that left thousands dead many more breathless, blind and in nizing pain. Few people know that ing the Bhopal gas tragedy a heroic ionmaster risked his own life to save rs.

n the evening of December 3, 1984, lam Dastagir was settling down in office to complete some pending

erwork. This work kept him in his office 1am in the night, when he emerged heck the arrival of the Gorakhpur

mbai Express. As he stepped on to platform, the deputy stationmaster his eyes burn and a queer itching ation in his throat. He did not know poisonous fumes leaking from Union bide’s pesticide factory were stealthily eloping the railway station.

eginning to choke, Dastagir did know then that twenty-three of his ay colleagues, including his boss,

ion superintendent Harish Dhurve, already died. It was later reported Dhurve had heard about the deadly and had immediately tried stopping
  

**115**

the movement of trains passing through Bhopal before collapsing in his office chamber. His suddenly worsening health and years of experience told Dastagir that something was very wrong. Though he did not fully comprehend what was happening, he decided to act immediately when he did not get any response from the station master. He alerted the senior staff at nearby stations, like Vidisha and Itarsi, to suspend all train traffic to Bhopal.

4\. However, the jam-packed Gorakhpur- Kanpur Express was already standing at the platform and its departure time was 20 minutes away. Listening to his gut instinct, Dastagir summoned his staff and told them to immediately clear the train for departure. When they asked if they should wait until the order to do so came from the head office, Dastagir replied that he would take complete responsibility for the train’s early departure. He wanted to ensure that the train left immediately, without any delay. His colleagues later recalled that Dastagir could barely stand and breathe as he spoke to them. Breaking all rules and without taking permission from anyone, he and his brave staff personally flagged off the train.

5\. But Dastagir’s work was not done. The railway station was filling up with people, desperate to flee the fumes. Some were gasping, others were vomiting, and most were weeping. Dastagir chose to remain on duty, running from one platform to another, attending, helping and consoling victims. He also sent an SOS to all the nearby railway offices, asking for immediate medical help. As a result, four ambulances with paramedics and railway doctors arrived at the station.

**The Inspector**: The thief broke into the house at around 10 p.m. What were you doing then?

**Mr. Umar**: I was watching a movie with my wife. Then I went to the kitchen to prepare tea.

**The Inspector**: How many minutes did you spend in the kitchen?

**Mr. Umar**: I think 10 or 15 minutes… I’m not sure….

**The Inspector**: Did you only prepare tea?

**Mr. Umar**: Yes.

**The Inspector**: OK. Thanks.

At the end of the questioning session, Mr.Umar told the inspector the truth.

“Last night, somebody called me, but he wasn’t my friend. I had borrowed some money from him and he had given me time till last night to return it. But I did not do so. So, he called home asking me to meet him outside the house. That’s why I went out. I did not tell my wife as I did not want her to know about it. When I went out, I saw a stranger entering my neighbour’s house but I did not stop as I was in a hurry to meet the moneylender.

Then he crawled back into the machine again and drew a little black cloth over himself. This time he was very quiet in there. I knew that he was praying and I kept still.

When the photographer came out at last, he looked very **grave** and shook his head.

“The face is quite wrong,” he said.

“I know,” I answered quietly; “I have always known it.”

He sighed.

“I think,” he said, “the face would be better three-quarters full.”

“I’m sure it would,” I said enthusiastically, for I was glad to find that the man had such a human side to him. “So would yours. In fact,” I continued, “how many faces one sees that are apparently hard, narrow, limited, but the minute you get them three-quarters full they get wide, large, almost **boundless** in–”

But the photographer had **ceased** to listen. He came over and took my head in his hands and twisted it sideways. I thought he meant to kiss me, and I closed my eyes.

But I was wrong.

Snick!

The photographer had pulled a string. The photograph was taken. I could see the machine still **staggering** from the shock.

“I think,” said the photographer, pursing his lips in a pleased smile, “that I caught the features just in a moment of **animation**.”

“So!” I said bitingly,– “features, eh? You didn’t think I could animate them, I suppose? But let me see the picture.”

“Oh, there’s nothing to see yet,” he said, “I have to develop the negative first. Come back on Saturday and I’ll let you see a proof of it.”

On Saturday I went back.

The photographer beckoned me in. I thought he seemed quieter and graver than before. I think, too, there was a certain pride in his manner.

He unfolded the proof of a large photograph, and we both looked at it in silence.

“Is it me?” I asked.

“Yes,” he said quietly, “it is you,” and we went on looking at it.

“The eyes,” I said hesitatingly, “don’t look very much like mine.”

“Oh, no,” he answered, “I’ve retouched them. They come out splendidly, don’t they?”

Take your negative, or whatever it is you call it–dip it in sulphide, bromide, oxide, cowhide–anything you like–remove the eyes, correct the mouth, adjust the face, restore the lips, reanimate the necktie and reconstruct the waistcoat. Coat it with an inch of gloss, shade it, **emboss** it, gild it, till even you acknowledge that it is finished. Then when you have done all that–keep it for yourself and your friends. They may value it. To me it is but a worthless **bauble.**” I broke into tears and left.

D. Discuss this aspect with your partner and share your views on how students can give back to society.

**E. Introduction**

**What goes around comes around!**

Every activity in a society, be it development of infrastructure, education, health care etc. demands resources of all kinds. Resources can be mobilized only through human efforts. This effort comes from many different sections of society. Thus, the fruits of development we enjoy today have come about only through the hardwork of many unsung heroes.

It is our duty to contribute to development by giving back what we have taken. When a qualified student embarks on his/her career, an element of service should always be a part of motivation. The society has cradled and nurtured every graduate to bloom and spread his/her wings. Graduation is the apt time to give back to society the gains we have obtained.

**Read an excerpt from the famous address**

**made by the great leader Arignar Anna,**

**at the Annamalai University, Tamil**

**Nadu, on November 18, 1967, on the**

**occasion of Convocation.**

Thankful as I am for the unique honour **conferred** on me by this institution. I stand before this august assembly today to deliver the Convocation address, for though it is a pleasure to be present on the happy occasion of greeting the graduates of the year and wishing them all a bright and prosperous future, it is not an easy task to place appropriate guidelines before them.

to play and the prominence is growing every day, as more and more individuals get themselves equipped for the task of bettering society in all its age when we have **eschewed** monarchy and **autocracy** and have inaugurated the era of democracy.

During the monarchical or **feudal** days, Universities had to train scholars and poets to adorn the chambers of royalty or the gilded mansions of lords and nobles and their wisdom was meant for the mansion, not for the market place. Those were days when numbers did not count, nor were eminent scholars asked to face the problems **confronting** the masses. They were content to work in **secluded**

**spheres**, far from the din and noise of the common man and weave the costly fabric of philosophy of poetry which in turn was to be converted into dazzling garments for the select and the privileged.

The role of the University today is not cloistered and confined as in the past. Its function has been enlarged\_not in its fundamentals but in its domain. It has to take into account the commonness, but trim and train, guide and lead him, before being asked to do his duty as the citizen of a democracy – a task which kindles sweet hopes but which demands patience and **perseverance, faith and confidence, faith** in himself and in others and confidence in his **inherent** ability to shoulder the responsibilities. The common man has become the origin of a potential ruler and the duty today, the responsibility today of the universities is to fashion out of him an individual fitted and equipped for the task of making democracy fruitful and effective.

While addressing the University russels, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, our er President, made the following

ement: “For its proper functioning ocracy requires more qualities than r forms of government. It is in the ersities that we can develop the spirit of democracy, appreciation thers’ points of view and adjustment differences through discussions. It be kept healthy and strong by the cise of individual responsibility and ement. In universities we have to ll the struggles of the past and realize perils and possibilities, the challenges opportunities, of the present.”

**r better understanding:**

cording to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan iversities ensure the democratic way life for the future generations. How?

Graduates of the year, I wish you prosperous future – for, after all, the ediate concern of every individual, uate or no graduate, is to acquire the ns for a decent living. That is the first ivation for all human activity and no one ignore it, but that ought not to be the objective. Something higher and nobler mere individual material advancement pected of you – for remember that this

versity education is a privilege that you y, for which you are deeply **indebted** to community of which you are a member.

**r better understanding:**

w can a University trim and train, ide and lead a person to function tter in society?
  

**141**

Most of the money needed for maintaining institutions of higher education come from the revenues collected from the community through the State, and a good proportion of that revenue comes from the **tillers** and the **toilers**, men who did not enjoy this privilege, men who willingly submit themselves to discomfort, so that they can enable the next generation to lead a better life. Graduates, may I ask you, how are you going to repay – what is to be your contribution to the social chest on which you have drawn so largely. Unless you **replenish** it richly, coming generations will find only an empty coffer.

**For better understanding:**

List the contributions of the educated youth to the society.

Your superior education increases your responsibility to society and therefore, apart from or along with your own individual advancement, society has got a right to expect an adequate return from you – not so much in terms of money as in terms of service – in toning up society, in bringing light into the dark alleys, sunshine into dingy places, solace into the afflicted, hope unto the **despondent** and a new life unto every one.

Unless service is the outcome, the **sermons** become sweet nothings. As Jefferson stated, “We must dream of an aristocracy of achievements arising out of a democracy of opportunities.”

The Purananuru song conveys the philosophy of Tamilians. It celebrates the selfless spirit and courage of people who served society by sharing everything with their fellowmen, even something as precious and unique as the nectar of immortality. They would never do a wrong deed even if they were offered the world as a reward. It is because of such men that the world continues to exist.

**Have you heard of Open Letters?**

An **open letter** is a letter that is intended to be read by a wide audience, or a letter intended for an individual, but that is nonetheless widely distributed intentionally through newspapers and other media, such as a letter to the editor or a blog.

Sociologists, scholars, anthropologists and historians have written open letters. Letters patent are another form of open letter in which a legal document is both mailed to a person by the government and publicized so that all are made aware of it. Open letters can also be addressed directly to a group rather than any individual.

Reading such letters will also help to improve your vocabulary. Here are some easy ways to improve and expand your vocabulary.

Gandhi Letter 23A: From Rabindranath Tagore

Shanti Niketan,

April 12, 1919.

Dear Mahatmaji,

Power in all its forms is irrational — it is like the horse that drags the carriage blindfolded. The moral element in it is only represented in the man who drives the horse. Passive resistance, a force which is not necessarily moral in itself, can be used against truth as well as for it. The danger inherent in all force grows stronger when it is likely to gain success, for then it becomes temptation. I know your teaching is to fight against evil by the help of the good. But such a fight is for heroes and not for men led by impulses of the moment. Evil on one side naturally begets evil on the other, injustice leading to violence and insult to vengefulness. Unfortunately, such a force has already been started, and either through panic or through wrath our authorities have shown us the claws whose sure effect is to drive some of us into the secret path of resentment and others into utter demoralization. In this crisis you, as a great leader of men, have stood among us to proclaim your faith in the ideal which you know to be that of India, the ideal which is both against the cowardliness of hidden revenge and the cowed submissiveness of the terror- stricken...

I have always felt, and said accordingly, that the great gift of freedom can never come to a people through charity. We must win it before we can own it. And India’s opportunity for winning it will

e to her when she can prove that she orally superior to the people who rule by their right of conquest. Armed with utter faith in goodness she must stand bashed before the arrogance that scoffs e power of spirit. And you have come

our motherland in the time of her need emind her of her mission, to lead her he true path of conquest, to purge her ent day politics of its feebleness which gines that it has gained its purpose n it struts in the borrowed feathers of omatic dishonesty. This is why I pray t fervently that nothing that tends to ken our spiritual freedom may intrude your marching line, that martyrdom he cause of truth may never degenerate fanaticism for mere verbal forms, ending into the self-deception that s itself behind sacred names.

h these few words for an introduction w me to offer the following as a poet’s tribution to your noble work:

e me the supreme courage of love, is my prayer, courage to speak, o, to suffer at thy will, ave all things or be left alone.

e me the supreme faith of love, is my prayer, faith of the life in death, e victory in defeat, e power hidden in the frailness of

beauty, e dignity of pain that accepts hurt,

disdains to return it.

Very sincerely yours, Rabindranath Tagore

B. Virat Kohli, the Man of the match and Man of the Series in the one–day International series between India and South Africa February 2018 had this to say during the post match presentation. India won the match by 8 wickets and won the series by 5 – 1, a historic win against South Africa in their home soil.

**Rewrite his words in Reported Speech.**

“It was a day I felt really good. Last game, I was not in the right kind of mindset. This is a beautiful place to bat under lights. That’s the idea behind bowling first. I like setting up for the short ball. It was a blessing in disguise, and they kept bowling short. I think the pitch got better to bat on under lights. It has been a roller coaster till now. People who are close to me deserve a lot of credit. Obviously, you want to lead from the front, and that’s a wonderful feeling. I have got eight or nine years left in my career and I want to make the most of every day. It’s a blessing that I am healthy and getting to captain my country. They have shown great character – especially the two young spinners. The way the series went augurs well for us. We’re looking forward to the T20s. The tour is not over yet. After losing the Test series, I was talking to you. I am here talking to you after winning the ODI series.”

C. Read the given passages and rewrite them in direct speech.

greatness of human virtues from the poet’s perspec

We are proud and feel so tall, Our **virtues** though be few and small Our nature it is that whatever we try We do with **devotion** deep and true.

Defeat we **repel**, courage our fort; **Cringing** from others we haven’t done, To seek a gain we **adore** none: We are proud and feel so tall.

We deem it our duty and mission in life, To bless and praise the deserving ones; Never shall we fail in what we commit, Shall nourish the ones that **nourish** the world

We are proud of the position we Hold; humble as we are, Our pride springs from the way we live. Ours is a path of dignity and honour, A life that knows no kneeling and bending. We are proud and feel so tall.

Everest is not the only peak, Every hillock has a **summit** to boast! The height you reach is not that we care; He, who does not **stoop**, is a king we adore. We bow before **competence** and **merit**; The ones that are true and stand on their own Are really the ladder for the rise of Man. Honour is a property, common to all: In dignity and pride no one need to be poor. We are proud and feel so tall.

**Now, read the story 'The Singing Lesson'**

**in which the attitude of an aggrieved**

**music teacher undergoes a drastic**

**change in keeping with her moods.**

With despair – cold, sharp despair – buried deep in her heart like a wicked knife, Miss Meadows, in cap and gown and carrying a little **baton**, trod the cold corridors that led to the music hall. Girls of all ages, rosy from the air, and bubbling over with that gleeful excitement that comes from running to school on a fine autumn morning, hurried, skipped, fluttered by; from the hollow classrooms came a quick drumming of voices; a bell rang; a voice like a bird cried, "Muriel."

**161**

"You look frozen," said she. Her blue

eyes opened wide; there came a mocking

light in them. (Had she noticed anything?)

"Oh, not quite as bad as that," said

Miss Meadows, and she gave the Science

Mistress, in exchange for her smile, a

quick **grimace** and passed on.

Forms Four, Five, and Six were

assembled in the music hall. The noise was

deafening. On the platform, by the piano,

stood Mary Beazley, Miss Meadowsʹ

favourite, who played **accompaniments**.

She was turning the music stool. When

she saw Miss Meadows she gave a loud,

warning "Sh-sh! Girls!" and Miss Meadows,

her hands thrust in her sleeves, the baton

under her arm, strode down the centre

aisle, mounted the steps, turned sharply,

seized the brass music stand, planted it in

front of her, and gave two sharp taps with

her baton for silence.

"Silence, please! Immediately!" and,

looking at nobody, her glance swept over

that sea of coloured flannel blouses, with

bobbing pink faces and hands, quivering

butterfly hair-bows, and music-books

outspread. She knew perfectly well

what they were thinking. "Meady is in a

wax." Well, let them think it! Her eyelids

quivered; she tossed her head, defying

them. What could the thoughts of those

creatures matter to someone who stood

there bleeding to death, pierced to the

heart, by such a letter —

— "I feel more and more strongly that our

marriage would be a mistake. Not that

truth to tell, I have come to the

clusion that I am not a marrying man,

tched out lightly and "regret" written

the top.

Basil! Miss Meadows stalked over

he piano. And Mary Beazley, who was

ing for this moment, bent forward;

curls fell over her cheeks while she

thed, "Good morning, Miss Meadows,"

she motioned towards rather than

ded to her mistress a beautiful yellow

santhemum. This little ritual of the

er had been gone through for ages

ages, quite a term and a half. It was

uch part of the lesson as opening

piano. But this morning, instead of

ng it up, instead of tucking it into her

while she leant over Mary and said,

ank you, Mary. How very nice! Turn to

e thirty-two," what was Mary's horror

n Miss Meadows totally ignored the

santhemum, made no reply to her

ting, but said in a voice of ice, "Page

teen, please, and mark the accents

."

Staggering moment! Mary blushed

l the tears stood in her eyes, but Miss

dows was gone back to the music

d; her voice rang through the music

.

"Page fourteen. We will begin with

e fourteen. 'A Lament.' Now, girls,

ought to know it by this time. We

l take it all together; not in parts, all

ther. And without expression. Sing it,

gh, quite simply, beating time with

left hand."
  

**162**

She raised the baton; she tapped the

music stand twice. Down came Mary on

the opening chord; down came all those

left hands, beating the air, and in chimed

those young, mournful voices:- "Fast! Ah,

too Fast Fade the Ro-o-ses of Pleasure;

Soon Autumn yields unto Wi-i-nter

Drear. Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly Mu-u-sic's Gay

Measure Passes away from the Listening

Ear."

Good Heavens, what could be more

tragic than that lament! Every note was a

sigh, a sob, a groan of awful mournfulness.

Miss Meadows lifted her arms in the wide

gown and began conducting with both

hands. "—I feel more and more strongly

that our marriage would be a mistake —"

she beat. And the voices cried: "Fleetly!

Ah, Fleetly." What could have possessed

him to write such a letter! What could have

led up to it! It came out of nothing. His

last letter had been all about a fumed-oak

bookcase he had bought for "our" books,

and a "natty little hall-stand" he had seen,

"a very neat affair with a carved owl on

a bracket, holding three hat-brushes in

its claws." How she had smiled at that! So

like a man to think one needed three hat-

brushes! "From the Listening Ear," sang

the voices.

 "Once again," said Miss Meadows. "But

this time in parts. Still without expression."

"Fast! Ah, too Fast." With the gloom of the

**contraltos** added, one could scarcely help

shuddering. "Fade the Roses of Pleasure."

Last time he had come to see her, Basil

had worn a rose in his buttonhole. How

handsome he had looked in that bright blue

suit, with that dark red rose! And he knew

it, too. He couldn't help knowing it. First

Again the two light taps; she lifted

her arms again. "Fast! Ah, too Fast." —

and the idea of settling down fills me with

nothing but disgust—" Disgust was what

he had written. That was as good as to say

their engagement was definitely broken

off. Broken off ! Their engagement! People

had been surprised enough that she had

got engaged. The Science Mistress would

not believe it at first. But nobody had been

as surprised as she. She was thirty. Basil

was twenty-five. It had been a miracle,

simply a miracle, to hear him say, as they

walked home from church that very dark

night, "You know, somehow or other, I've

got fond of you." And he had taken hold of

the end of her ostrich feather boa. "Passes

away from the Listening Ear."

"Repeat! Repeat!" said Miss Meadows.

"More expression, girls! Once more!"

"Fast! Ah, too Fast." The older girls

were crimson; some of the younger ones

began to cry. Big spots of rain blew against

the windows, and one could hear the

willows whispering, "— not that I do not

love you— "

"But, my darling, if you love me,"

thought Miss Meadows, "I don't mind

how much it is. Love me as little as you

like." But she knew he didn't love her. Not

to have cared enough to scratch out that

word "disgust," so that she couldn't read it!

"Soon Autumn yields unto Winter Drear."

She would have to leave the school, too.

"Pay no attention to letter, must have

she read. She couldn't take her eyes off the

telegram.

"I do hope it's nothing very serious," said

Miss Wyatt, leaning forward.

"Oh, no, thank you, Miss Wyatt,"

blushed Miss Meadows. "It's nothing bad

at all. It's" – and she gave an apologetic

little laugh – "it's from my **fiance** saying

that – saying that –" There was a pause. "I

see," said Miss Wyatt. And another pause.

Then, "You've fifteen minutes more of

your class, Miss Meadows, haven't you?"

"Yes, Miss Wyatt." She got up. She half ran

towards the door.

"Oh, just one minute, Miss Meadows,"

said Miss Wyatt. "I must say I don't approve

of my teachers having telegrams sent to

them in school hours, unless in case of

very bad news, such as death," explained

Miss Wyatt, "or a very serious accident, or

something to that effect. Good news, Miss

Meadows, will always keep, you know."

On the wings of hope, of love, of joy,

Miss Meadows sped back to the music

hall, up the aisle, up the steps, over to the

piano.

"Page thirty-two, Mary," she said,

"page thirty-two," and, picking up the

yellow chrysanthemum, she held it to her

lips to hide her smile. Then she turned

to the girls, rapped with her baton: "Page

**Warm Up**

Often on formal occasions, we admire friends and strangers who appear elegant, who are pleasant to converse with and who conduct themselves gracefully. At times, we also see people who are awkward, nervous and doubtful about their next move.

Recall a few examples of awkward actions that can cause discomfort or disturbance to others like spilling a cup of hot drink on someone nearby.

Of all the things I am not very good at, living in the real world is perhaps the most outstanding. I am constantly filled with wonder at the number of things that other people do without any evident difficulty that are pretty much beyond me. I cannot tell you the number of times that I have gone looking for the lavatory

I was thinking about this the last time went en famille on a big trip. It was aster, and we were flying to England a week. When we arrived at Logan ort in Boston and were checking in, I

denly remembered that I had recently ed British Airways’ frequent flyer ramme. I also remembered that I

The zip on the bag was jammed. So I pulled on it and **yanked** at it, with grunts and frowns and increasing **consternation**. I kept this up for some minutes but it wouldn’t budge, so I pulled harder and harder, with more grunts. Well, you can guess what happened. Abruptly the zip gave way. The side of the bag flew open and everything within — newspaper cuttings and other loose papers, a 14- ounce tin of pipe tobacco, magazines, passport, English money, film — was **extravagantly** ejected over an area about the size of a tennis court.

I watched dumbstruck as a hundred carefully sorted documents came raining down in a fluttery **cascade**, coins bounced to a variety of noisy oblivions and the now- lidless tin of tobacco rolled crazily across the **concourse** disgorging its contents as it went.

“My tobacco!” I cried in horror, thinking what I would have to pay for that much tobacco in England now that another Budget had come and gone, and then changed the cry to “My finger! My finger!” as I discovered that I had **gashed** my finger on the zip and was shedding blood in a lavish manner.

fully justified.) Confused and unable elp, my hair went into panic mode.

It was at this point that my wife ed at me with an expression of wonder

not anger or **exasperation,** but just ple wonder — and said, “I can’t believe do this for a living.”

But I’m afraid it’s so. I always have **strophes** when I travel. Once on an plane, I leaned over to tie a shoelace

at the moment someone in the seat ad of me threw his seat back into

recline, and found myself pinned lessly in the crash position. It was only lawing the leg of the man sitting next e that I managed to get myself freed.

This, however, was not my worst rience on a plane flight. My worst rience was when I was writing important ghts in a notebook (‘buy socks’, ‘clutch ks carefully’, etc.), sucking thoughtfully he end of my pen as you do, and fell into versation with an attractive young lady he next seat. I amused her for perhaps

inutes with a scattering of urbane bons s, then retired to the lavatory where I overed that the pen had leaked and that mouth, chin, tongue, teeth and gums

e now a striking, scrub-resistant navy , and would remain so for several days.
  

**170**

So you will understand, I trust, when

I tell you how much I ache to be **suave**. I

would love, just once in my life, to rise from a

dinner table without looking as if I have just

experienced an extremely localised seismic

event, get in a car and close the door without

leaving 14 inches of coat outside, wear light-

coloured trousers without discovering at the

end of the day that I have at various times

sat on chewing gum, ice cream, cough syrup

and motor oil. But it is not to be.

Now on planes when the food is

delivered, my wife says: “Take the lids off

the food for Daddy” or “Put your hoods up,

children. Daddy’s about to cut his meat.”

Of course, this is only when I am fl ying

with my family. When I am on my own,

I don’t eat, drink or lean over to tie my

shoelaces, and never put a pen anywhere

near my mouth. I just sit very, very quietly,

sometimes on my hands to keep them from

fl ying out unexpectedly and causing liquid

mischief. It’s not much fun, but it does at

least cut down on the laundry bills.

I never did get my frequent fl yer miles,

by the way. I never do. I couldn’t fi nd the card

in time. Th is has become a real frustration for

me. Everyone I know — everyone — is for

ever fl ying off to Bali fi rst class with their air

miles. I never get to collect anything. I must fl y

100,000 miles a year, yet I have accumulated

only about 212 air miles divided between

twenty-three airlines.

This is because either I forget to

**Speaking Activity**
  

**174**

Do you know the difference between

transcription and translation?

Transcription is the process of listening to

an audio file and writing what has been

said verbatim in the same language that

the original speaker used.

Translation is the process of expressing the

sense of a written text to another language

i.e. converting from one language to

another without changing the meaning.

The ability to translate is both a skill and

an art. Translation can be done from the

language being learned (here it is English)

into the mother tongue or from the mother

tongue into English.

Have you ever heard of the term

transliteration?

Transliteration gives the word from a

different language in letters that you

can read so as to be able to pronounce it

properly.

e.g. Vanakkam for tzf;fk; ( Tamil)

**Narration**

Narration is a recital of events, especially in

chronological order, as the story narrated

in a poem or the exposition in a drama.

The narrative form is the most common

mode of writing. Even news is narrated as

and interesting.

**rative Writing**

re are many ways of expressing our ghts and ideas in an. interesting ner. One way is to present them as a ation. In this section we shall learn to develop a proverb and a news

dline into a story paragraph.

y story has a beginning, middle and an ing. Here is the format for developing a y:

**oduction / Beginning**

escribe the setting ( where?, when?) ntroduce the characters ( who?) xplain the situation.

**nts / Middle**

escribe what happened. se transition words that show time

nd order ( suddenly, as soon as, before, eanwhile)

**tion / Ending**

xplain how the story ends escribe what happens to the characters.

tate how the problem ends / gets esolved dd a reflection sentence or a closing

entence.

**example: Expand the Proverb ‘A bad kman always blames his tools’** **into a**

**y-paragraph. Notice the beginning,**

**dle and the ending. Begin with the**

**ning of the proverb.**

**ad workman always blames his tools’.**

meaning of this proverb is that our ess does not depend on what kind of s we have but how we use them. Here story to elucidate the meaning.

**Writing**
  

**177**

Raj and Ravi were farmers. They owned a pair of oxen each with which they ploughed their lands. Raj put in hard work while Ravi hardly worked. Raj worked all day long, aimed at getting a good yield and took good care of his oxen, fully understanding their needs. Ravi, on the other hand, was very lazy and miserly. He never fed his oxen well but exploited them to the maximum.

As a true friend, Raj advised Ravi and sometimes even admonished him for his treatment of the animals. Ravi paid little heed to Raj’s words. He soon bought a tractor to plough his land and chased the oxen away. Raj brought home the animals and took care of them too though he could not afford it. The monsoon soon arrived and it was time for cultivation. Raj’s land was well-ploughed and ready for cultivation - thanks to his oxen.

Ravi in his miserly fashion had not maintained his tractor well and it kept giving him trouble. As a result, he could not get his field ready for cultivation on time. He lamented and blamed it all on bad luck not realizing that it was he who was responsible for his miserable state. Ravi not only lost out on a good yield because of his laziness, but also spent a huge sum of money to repair his tractor due to poor maintenance. Despite having better equipment, Ravi was unable to get the best results. But, Raj was a good workman and hence was able to succeed with the limited resources he had.

Now write a short story to explain these proverbs.

1\. Actions speak louder than words. 2. Despair gives courage to a coward.

**b. The historical background:**

The poem is an extract from William

Shakespeare’s play **King Richard the**

**Second**. The play is based on true events

that occurred towards the end of the 14th

century.

Richard II was crowned the King of

England in the year 1367. He continued to

be the British Monarch until 1399, when

he was deposed by his cousin, Henry

of Bolingbroke, who crowned himself

King Henry the Fourth in the same year.

Shakespeare’s play is a dramatic rendition

of the last two years of King Richard II’s

life. In this brief span of time, he was

ousted from his royal position and sent to

prison, where he died in captivity.

First, listen to a reading of the complete poem. Th questions briefly, based on your understanding. You end of the monologue to help you.

Let’s talk of graves, of worms, and **epitaphs**, Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth. Let’s choose **executors** and talk of wills. And yet not so – for what can we **bequeath**

Save our **deposed** bodies to the ground?

A. Fill in the blanks using the words given in the box to complete the summary of the poem:

King Richard the second had surrendered to his (a)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cousin, Bollingbroke. He experienced deep distress at the horror of his circumstances. In that desperate situation, he speaks of (b)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, (c)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, (d)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and other things connected with death. He spoke of how people leave nothing behind and can call nothing their own, except for the small patch of (e)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, where they will be buried. King Richard yielded to dejection and talked of all the different ways in which defeated kings suffer how some had been deposed, (f )\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in war, (g)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by their wives and so forth. He attributed this loss of lives to (h)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, who he personified as the jester who watches over the shoulder of every ruler, who mocks kings by allowing them to think their human flesh, was like (i)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_brass. However, Death penetrates through the castle walls, silently and unnoticed like a sharp (j)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, thus bidding (k)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to him and all his pride forever. Finally, Richard appealed to his soldiers not to mock his mere flesh and blood by showing (l) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and respect to him. He added that he too needed bread to live, felt want, tasted (m)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and needed (n)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. He concluded thus, urging his men not to call him a (o)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as he was only human, just like the rest of them.

Scene: The **lounge** of JACK and JILL’S Villa at

**Jill:** And this is the lounge.

**Aunt Jane:**

Charming! Charming! Such a **cosy** little room! And such pretty furniture.

**Jack (modestly):**

**Aunt Jane:**

Oh, have you got a radiogram as well as a car and a piano?

**Jack:**

Why, of course, Aunt Jane. You simply must have a radio set nowadays.

No, no, Aunt Jane. You misunderstood me. We don’t pay rent because the house is ours.

**Aunt Jane:** YOURS?

**Jill:**

Why, yes; you just pay ten pounds and it’s yours.

**Jack:**

You see, Aunt Jane, we realized how uneconomic it is to go on paying rent year after year, when you can buy and enjoy a home of your own for ten pounds—and a few quarterly payments, of course. Why be Mr .Tenant when you can be Mr. Owner?

**Aunt Jane:**

I see. Yes, there’s something in that. Even so, you must be getting on very well to keep up a place like this.

**Jill:**

Oh, he is, Aunt Jane. Why, only last year he had a five shilling rise—didn’t you, Jack?

**Jack (modestly):**

Of course that was nothing, really. I’m expecting ten this Christmas.

**Aunt Jane:**

Good heavens! And how much do you earn?

**Jack:**

As a matter of fact—er—that is—six pounds.

**Aunt Jane:**

But that’s **absurd**! How can you pay seven pounds eight and eight pence out of six pounds?

**Jack:**

Oh, that’s easy. You see, all you have to do is to borrow the rest of the money for the payments from the Thrift and Providence Trust Corporation.

**Jill:**

They’re only too glad to loan you any amount you like, on note of hand alone.

**Unit - 1 (Prose)**

The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. It is the mother who rocks the cradle. It is she who exercises her influence over the mind of her children. She moulds the character of her children with her noble qualities. Napoleon said, “Give me good mothers, I will give you a good nation.” Mothers play an important role in building nations. The love of our mother is usually the first and deepest love that we come across. For many people their mother’s love becomes the pattern of love in later life.

A mother’s love is unconditional. No matter what you do, you know that your mother will always love you. The phrase ‘mother’s love’ derives from the love traditionally shown by a biological mother to her child. But indeed any love that is deeply caring and unconditional can be described as a motherly love. Adoptive mothers show this type of love to the children they adopt. It is important in life to be cherished and loved for who you are and to be supported in all you do. Love is the most important thing in the world. Why not exhibit love to creatures and all those around you?

**Father by Edgar Albert Guest**

My father knows the proper way The nation should be run;

He tells us children every day Just what should now be done.

He knows the way to fix the trusts,

“

4 Yuv poin for the run SIX nati Wh can Sach and in M ball of s  

He has a simple plan; But if the furnace needs repairs,

We have to hire a man.

My father, in a day or two Could land big thieves in jail;

There’s nothing that he cannot do, He knows no word like “fail.”

Our confidence” he would restore, Of that there is no doubt;

But if there is a chair to mend, We have to send it out.

In conversation father can Do many wondrous things; He’s built upon a wiser plan

Than presidents or kings. He knows the ins and outs of each

And every deep transaction; We look to him for theories,

But look to ma for action.

Kookaburra soared over the fence. Bhajji too is in tears. 28 years in waiting and the helicopter shot has brought an end to the game.

The finishers of old times Dhoni and Yuvraj, who were popularly called 'The Finishers' against Pakistan and Sri Lanka a few years ago, took the game closer and a thrilling finish was on the cards. They needed 30 off 30 deliveries when the batting power play became mandatory. Could they do it? They were up against a lethal bowler in Malinga. Just three runs of the Malinga over meant the Indians needed 27 off the next four overs. There were nerves all around, but the two batsmen in the middle looked to be in a different world altogether. Pressure was just a distant relative and they kept their cool to help India romp home with 10 deliveries to spare.

**“To Autumn” by William Blake (1783**)

O Autumn, laden with fruit, and stain’d With the blood of the grape, pass not, but

sit Beneath my shady roof; there thou may’st

rest, And tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe, And all the daughters of the year shall

dance! Sing now the lusty song of fruits and

flowers.

“The narrow bud opens her beauties to The sun, and love runs in her thrilling

veins; Blossoms hang round the brows of

Morning, and Flourish down the bright cheek of

modest Eve, Till clust’ring Summer breaks forth into

singing, And feather’d clouds strew flowers round

her head.

The spirits of the air live in the smells Of fruit; and joy, with pinions light, roves

round The gardens, or sits singing in the trees.” Thus sang the jolly Autumn as he sat, Then rose, girded himself, and o’er the

bleak Hills fled from our sight; but left his

golden load.
