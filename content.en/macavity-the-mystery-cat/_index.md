Macavity’s a Mystery Cat: he’s called the Hidden Paw
For he’s the master criminal who can **defy** the Law.
He’s the **bafflement** of **Scotland Yard**, the **Flying** Squad’s despair:
For when they reach the scene of crime — Macavity’s not there!


Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
He’s broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.
His powers of **levitation** would make a **fakir** stare,
And when you reach the scene of crime — Macavity’s not there!


You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air —
But I tell you once and once again, Macavity’s not there!
Macavity’s a **ginger cat**, he’s very tall and thin;
You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in. 


His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed;
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake;
And when you think he’s half asleep, he’s always wide awake.


Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
For he’s a **fiend** in **feline** shape, a monster of **depravity**.
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square —
But when a crime’s discovered, then Macavity’s not there!


He’s outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)
And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard’s.
And when the **larder’s** looted, or the jewel-case is **rifled**,
Or when the milk is missing, or another **Peke’s** been **stifled**,


Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the **trellis** past repair
Ay, there’s the wonder of the thing! Macavity’s not there!
And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty’s gone astray,
Or the **Admiralty** lose some plans and drawings by the way


There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair
But it’s useless to investigate, Macavity’s not there!
And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:
‘It must have been Macavity!’ but he’s a mile away.


You’ll be sure to find him resting, or a licking of his thumbs,
Or engaged in doing complicated long division sums.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
There never was a Cat of such **deceitfulness** and **suavity**.


He always has an **alibi**, and one or two to spare:
At whatever time the deed took place, MACAVITY WASN’T THERE!
And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known,
(I might mention **Mungojerrie**, I might mention **Griddlebone**)
Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time
Just controls their operations: the **Napoleon of Crime**.
