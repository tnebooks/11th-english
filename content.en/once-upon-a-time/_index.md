Once upon a time, son  

They used to laugh with their hearts 

 And laugh with their eyes: 

 But now they only **laugh with their teeth** 

 While their **ice-block-cold eyes**  

 **Search behind my shadow.** 

 


There was a time indeed 

 They used to shake hands with their hearts 

 But that’s gone, son 

 Now they shake hands without hearts 

** While their left hands search 

 My empty pockets.** 

 


 “Feel at home!”, “Come again”: 

 They say, and when I come 

 Again and feel 

 At home, once, twice 

 There will be no thrice - 

 For then I find doors shut on me. 

  So I have learnt many things, 

 son I have learned to wear many faces 

 Like dresses – home face 

 Office face, street face, host face 

** Cocktail face,** with all their ** conforming smiles 

 Like a fixed portrait smile.** 

 

 

 And I have learned too  

To laugh with only my teeth 

 And shake hands without my heart 

 I have also learned to say “Goodbye”  

When I mean **“Good-riddance”:** 

 To say “Glad to meet you”  

Without being glad; and to say “It’s been 

 Nice talking to you”, after being bored 


But believe me, son  

I want to be what I used to be 

 When I was like you. I want  

To unlearn all these muting things 

 Most of all, I want to relearn 

 How to laugh, for my laugh in the mirror 

 Shows only my teeth like a snake’s bare** fangs!** 

 

 So show me, son  

How to laugh; show me how 

 I used to laugh and smile 





 **About the Author** 

 

**Gabriel Okara** (born 1921) is a Nigerian poet and novelist. His verse has been translated into several languages. His poem The Call of the River Nun won the best award for Literature at the Nigerian Festival of Arts in 1953. Some of his poems were published in the influential periodical Black Orpheus, and by 1960 he established himself as an accomplished writer. He was honoured with the Commonwealth Poetry Award. Okara’s typical poem transits from everyday reality to moments of delight and moves back to reality, making a complete circle. Okara infused African thought, folklore, and imagery into both his verse and prose. His first novel, The Voice, is an outstanding linguistic experiment. His later works include a collection of poems The Fisherman’s Invocation (1978) and two books for children, Little Snake and Little Frog (1981) and An Adventure to Juju Island (1992).
