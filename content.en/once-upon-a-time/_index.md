Once upon a time, son They used to laugh with their hearts And laugh with their eyes: But now they only **laugh with their teeth**

While their **ice-block-cold eyes**

**Search behind my shadow**.

There was a time indeed They used to shake hands with their hearts But that’s gone, son Now they shake hands without hearts **While their left hands search**

**My empty pockets**.

“Feel at home!”, “Come again”: They say, and when I come Again and feel At home, once, twice There will be no thrice - For then I find doors shut on me.

So I have learnt many things, son I have learned to wear many faces Like dresses – home face Office face, street face, host face **Cocktail face**, with all their **conforming smiles**

**Like a fixed portrait smile**.

And I have learned too To laugh with only my teeth And shake hands without my heart I have also learned to say “Goodbye” When I mean “**Good-riddance**”: To say “Glad to meet you” Without being glad; and to say “It’s been Nice talking to you”, after being bored.

But believe me, son I want to be what I used to be When I was like you. I want To unlearn all these muting things Most of all, I want to relearn How to laugh, for my laugh in the mirror Shows only my teeth like a snake’s bare **fangs!**

So show me, son How to laugh; show me how I used to laugh and smile Once upon a time when I was like you.
