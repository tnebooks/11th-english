and slight **swagger**, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The **vicinity** was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed.

When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly.

“It’s all right, officer,” he said, **reassuringly**. “I’m just waiting for a friend. It’s an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little funny to you, doesn’t it? Well, I’ll explain if you’d like to make certain it’s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands—Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant.”

“Until five years ago,” said the policeman. “It was torn down then.”

The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarf pin was a large diamond, oddly set.

“Twenty years ago tonight,” said the man, “I dined here at Big Joe Brady’s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to start for

“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the ceman. “Rather a long time between ts, though, it seems to me. Haven’t you

“Well, yes, for a time we esponded,” said the other. “But after a or two we lost track of each other. You

The waiting man pulled out a dsome watch, the lids of it set with ll diamonds.

“Three minutes to ten,” he announced. as exactly ten o’clock when we parted at the restaurant door.”

“Did pretty well out West, didn’t ?” asked the policeman.

“You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half ell. He was a kind of **plodder**, though,

good fellow as he was. I’ve had to compete with some of the sharpest **wits** going to get my pile. A man gets in a **groove** in New York. It takes the West to put a **razor-edge**

The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.

“I’ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to call time on him sharp?”

“I should say not!” said the other. “I’ll give him half an hour at least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time. So long, officer.”

“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he went.

There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried **dismally** and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware

“Moderately. I have a position in one he city departments. Come on, Bob; l go around to a place I know of, and e a good long talk about old times.”

The two men started up the street, in arm. The man from the West, **egotism** enlarged by success, was

career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest.

At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other’s face. The man from the West stopped sud- denly and released his arm.

“You’re not Jimmy Wells,” he snapped. “Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change a man’s nose from a Roman to a pug.”

“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one”, said the tall man. “You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob. Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and **wires** us she wants to have a chat with you. Going quietly, are you? That’s sensible. Now, before we go on to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it here at the window. It’s from Patrolman Wells.”

The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed to him. His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the time he had finished. The note was rather short.
