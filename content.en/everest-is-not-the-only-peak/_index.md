Now, read the poem ‘Everest is not the Only Peak’ in blank verse and get to know the greatness of human virtues from the poet’s perspective.

We are proud and feel so tall,
Our **virtues** though be few and small
Our nature it is that whatever we try
We do with **devotion** deep and true.

Defeat we **repel**, courage our fort;
**Cringing** from others we haven’t done,
To seek a gain we **adore** none:
We are proud and feel so tall.

We deem it our duty and mission in life,
To bless and praise the deserving ones;
Never shall we fail in what we commit, 
Shall nourish the ones that **nourish** the world. 

We are proud of the position we
Hold; humble as we are,
Our pride springs from the way we live.
Ours is a path of dignity and honour,
A life that knows no kneeling and bending.
We are proud and feel so tall.

Everest is not the only peak,
Every hillock has a summit to boast!
The height you reach is not that we care; 
He, who does not **stoop**, is a king we adore.
We bow before **competence** and **merit**;
The ones that are true and stand on their own 
Are really the ladder for the rise of Man.
Honour is a property, common to all:
In dignity and pride no one need to be poor.
We are proud and feel so tall.
