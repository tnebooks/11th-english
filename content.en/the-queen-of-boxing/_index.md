the AIBA) World Women’s Boxing Championships in Pennsylvania, USA, in November–December 2001.

My father managed to collect only Rs 2,000 for my trip. I was both upset and very worried because I’d heard of

how expensive things were in America. But there was nothing my parents or I could do. I spoke to Onler, one of my friends, about my problem. He invited a few students and elders, who went to meet the two Members of Parliament and seek their help. Two MPs donated Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 3,000 respectively and I suddenly had Rs 10,000 in my hands. With this **princely** sum, and a little more that had been collected from people, I left for the US. I was relieved to have money in my pocket, and knew that I could not come back empty-handed after all the efforts that people had made on my behalf.

Pennsylvania was cold and beautiful. It was snowing. We were confined to the sports arena, but what little I saw was pleasing to the eye. The people were enormously nice too. It was the first time in my life that I had travelled so far. I was looking forward to seeing what America was all about. But since we were the last team to arrive, we went straight to the sporting arena from the airport. The other

s had already completed their weight which is compulsory for all players. s tired and suffering from **jet lag**. It

been morning when I left, and here as morning again. After weighing in, und out that I did not have any match day. I was fortunate, but some of the -mates were not so lucky. I was able

est well enough to face my opponent he round, which I won comfortably. fear of facing new opponents quickly ished. I competed in the 48 kg in this mpionship. While team-mates lost after the other, I went on to reach the ls. I was even hopeful of winning the . The boxers were not unbeatable as I

earlier thought.

I felt like this would be the place, event that would change my life.

pt telling myself, “I can face anyone in ring.” In the quarter–final, I defeated ia Hokmi of Poland by RSC (Referee ped Contest–applicable if the referee

s one of the boxers is inferior to the r and risks getting hurt badly), and in semi-final, I defeated Jamie Behal of ada by 21-9. I reached the finals, but to Hula Sahin of Turkey by 13-5.

The greatest disadvantage for me was loss of **appetite**. I was not accustomed he food there. Try as I might, I could

eat the food and I started to lose ht. So much so that just before the

ls I was only 46 kg. This is probably t cost me my dream of winning gold I was very disappointed. I went to room and cried. But the coaches were ; they consoled me and **lauded** me on

silver win. I was the only one in the to get a medal. But the biggest thing
  

**36**

I took away from this championship was the **conviction** that I could take on any boxer.

In the course of my career, I have become used to travel and to the different ways that things work in other countries. One time, in China, we were given chopsticks to eat our meals with. Just when I had painfully begun to master the art of using a knife and fork, I had to use two sticks to fill my stomach. I ended up using both my hands to hold the chopstick to pick up the food and push it into my mouth. My teammates asked for spoons but I tried to manage with the sticks. It helped that I really enjoy Chinese food. I was hungry enough that I managed the complex work required – I ate enough to **sate** my appetite and my **palate**. After five years of travelling, I started taking along some packed food from home.

On my return, Delhi gave me a warm welcome at the airport. Back in Imphal, I was greeted with garlands and drumbeats and dancing. There was a victory ride across town, a **felicitation** programme was held in Langol, an area that houses the government quarters. Thanksgiving prayers were said and words of praise and **adulation** were showered on me. I was presented with a traditional shawl. Oja Ibomcha was also present and was duly felicitated. When I spoke to the people in Langol that day, I spoke of my hope that I would win gold in future tournaments.

That first international medal, a silver, will always mean a lot to me. The fight and all that followed are clearly **etched** in my memory. But deep inside, I was not happy

with I vo back

M mar amo that  

a silver. As I touched down in India, wed that the next time I would bring a gold. I knew I was good enough.

The silver in Pennsylvania and the e money from the government had an end to my immediate financial

ries. But I wanted a job too, for that e can bring long-term security and a dy income. Also, around the time that as getting married, I had no savings pt a couple of life insurance policies. r my second World Championship , the Manipur government offered the post of Sub-Inspector, which I pted in 2005. I had long dreamt of ing a government job through the rts quota, and it was finally fulfilled. I ed a salary of Rs. 15,000 in that first

The thing about jobs that are obtained ugh the sports quota is that we are not ired to go in to work as regularly as

colleagues because we tend to be away amps and tournaments through much

e year. I go to office when necessary. every time I need to go out of station, required to take leave and inform the

artment.

title in the Third World Women’s Boxing Championships at Podolsk in Russia, in 2005. Sarita, who had won the bronze, and I were given a hero’s welcome at the Imphal airport. We were taken to the Bhagyachandra Open Air Theatre, where a grand reception was organised.

I’d had a good run from 2001 to 2004. I won several golds: all the Senior Women’s Boxing Championships; the 2nd Women’s Boxing Championships, 2002; the 2nd Asian Women’s Boxing Championships at Hisar in 2003; and the Witch Cup Boxing Championships at Paes, Hungary. In spite of this, when I got married, everybody was doubtful that my medal hauls would continue. But after the wedding, I participated in and won a gold in the Third and Fourth World Women’s Boxing Championships in October 2005 and November 2006.

There were a number of other international level championships, in Taiwan, Vietnam, Denmark and so on. But it was retaining my world title in 2006 by defeating Steluta Duta of Romania 22-7 at the Fourth World Championships in New Delhi that I consider one of my greatest achievements. It is probably the most memorable for me because I was able to win at home. The other Indian boxers also performed exceptionally well. India won four golds, one silver and three bronzes, and our team won the overall title. With this hat-trick of World Championship wins, the media christened me ‘Queen of Boxing’ and ‘Magnificent Mary’.

**Reading**

Encoding and Decoding

We can present information or data in a visual form through tables, graphs etc., or in a verbal form as reports or articles.

Tables and figures make the presentation not only simple and clear but attractive as well.

Encoding and Decoding are two common and useful strategies in presenting data or facts.

**Encoding** is the process by which data (facts, figures, etc.) is presented in a non- verbal form, i.e., as tables, graphs, etc.

**Decoding** is the process by which graphic representations such as tables and graphs are interpreted so that the data is made meaningful to the readers.

**The Value of Games in Education**

**By M. Sathyapriya, XI-F**

The aim of education is to enable the human personality to grow to its full stature. We have a body, a mind and a spirit. Accordingly, education aims at our physical, intellectual, spiritual and moral development.

Games are a means of keeping the body healthy and fit. Physical fitness and freedom from all kinds of ailments are the desire and ambition of every human being. Indeed, good health is the first condition of happiness in life. Those who play games generally maintain good health. Games are an excellent means of bodily exercise. Whether it is sophisticated games like hockey, football and tennis or simple games like Kabaddi, they provide the much needed exercise to the body and thus keep the body healthy and strong. Players always have a better appetite and a better digestion than those who play no games or do exercises. Games not only make the body healthy and strong, but also make it muscular.

Apart from building the body, games are an excellent recreation or pastime. Education teaches people the need and
