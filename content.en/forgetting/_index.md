mindedness is

common. It is

the efficiency

rather than the

inefficiency of

human memory

that compels my

wonder. Modern

man remembers

even telephone

numbers. He

remembers the

addresses of his friends. He remembers the

dates of good **vintages**.

He remembers appointments for

lunch and dinner. His memory is crowded

with the names of actors and actresses and

cricketers and footballers and murderers.

He can tell you what the weather was like

in a long-past August and the name of the

provincial hotel at which he had a vile meal

during the summer. In his ordinary life,

again, he remembers almost everything

that he is expected to remember. How

many men in all London forget a single

item of their clothing when dressing in the

morning? Not one in a hundred. Perhaps

not one in ten thousand. How many of

them forget to shut the front door when

leaving the house? Scarcely more. And so it

goes on through the day, almost everybody

remembering to do the right things at the

right moment till it is time to go to bed,

and then the ordinary man seldom forgets

to turn off the lights before going upstairs.

There are, it must be admitted, some

matters in regard to which the memory

works with less than its usual perfection. It

is only a very methodical man, I imagine,

who can always remember to take the

. This is the more surprising because

icine should be one of the easiest

gs to remember. As a rule, it is

posed to be taken before during, or

r meals and the meal itself should be a

inder of it. The fact remains, however,

few but the moral giants remember

ake their medicine regularly. Certain

hologists tell us that we forget things

use we wish to forget them, and it may

hat it is because of their **antipathy** to

and potions; that many people fail to

ember them at the appointed hours.

This does not explain, however, how

that a life-long devotee of medicines

myself is as forgetful of them as those

take them most unwillingly. The very

spect of a new and widely advertised

stuff in my pockets, I forget about it

he commonest form of forgetfulness,

ppose, occurs in the matter of posting

rs. So common is it that I am always

**ctant** to trust a departing visitor to

t an important letter. So little do I rely

is memory that I put him on his oath

re handing the letter to him. As for

elf, anyone who asks me to post a letter

poor judge of character. Even if I carry

letter in my hand I am always past the

pillar-box before I remember that I

ht to have posted it. Weary of holding

my hand, I then put it for safety into

of my pockets and forget all about it.

r that, it has an unadventurous life till
  

**68**

a long chain of circumstances leads to a

number of embarrassing questions being

asked, and I am compelled to produce

the evidence of my guilt from my pocket.

This, it might be thought, must be due to

a lack of interest in other people’s letters;

but that cannot be the explanation, for I

forget to post some even of the few letters

that I myself remember to write.

As for leaving articles in trains and

in taxies, I am no great **delinquent** in such

matters. I can remember almost anything

except books and walking-sticks and I can

often remember even books. Walking-

sticks I find it quite impossible to keep.

I have an old-fashioned taste for them,

and I buy them frequently but no-sooner

do I pay a visit to a friend’s house or go a

journey in a train, than another stick is on

its way into the world of the lost. I dare

not carry an umbrella for fear of losing

it. To go through life without ever having

lost an umbrella- has even the grimmest—

jawed umbrella-carrier ever achieved this?

Few of us, however, have lost

much property on our travels through

forgetfulness. The ordinary man arrives

at his destination with all his bags and

trunks safe. The list of articles lost in

trains during the year suggests that it is

the young rather than the adult who forget

things, and that sportsmen have worse

memories than their ordinary serious-

minded fellows. A considerable number

of footballs and cricket-bats, for instance,

were forgotten. This is easy to understand,

for boys, returning from the games, have

their imaginations still filled with a vision

of the playing-field, and their heads are

among the stars — or their hearts in their

ts — as they recall their **exploits** or

from remembering to do such small

**saic** things as take the ball or the bat

them when they leave the train.

For the rest of the day, they are

ens of dreamland. The same may be

, no doubt, of anglers who forget their

ing-rods. Anglers are generally said —

not know with what justification- to

he most imaginative of men, and the

who is inventing magnificent lies on

journey home after a day’s fishing is

nd to be a little absent-minded in his

aviour. The fishing-rod of reality is

otten by him as he day-dreams over

fears of the fishing-rod of Utopia. His

of memory is really a tribute to the

nsity of his enjoyment in thinking

ut his day’s sport. He may forget his

ing-rod, as the poet may forget to post

tter, because his mind is filled with

ter more glorious.

Absent-mindedness of this kind

s to me all but a virtue. The absent-

ded man is often a man who is making

best of life and therefore has no time

emember the **mediocre**. Who would

e trusted Socrates or Coleridge to post

The question whether the possession

good memory is altogether desirable

often been discussed, and men with

**ble** memories have sometimes tried

ake out a case for their superiority.

man, they say, who is a perfect

embering machine is seldom a man

he first intelligence, and they quote
  

**69**

various cases of children or men who had marvellous memories and who yet had no intellect to speak of. I imagine, however, that on the whole the great writers and the great composers of music have been men with exceptional powers of memory. The poets I have known have had better memories than the stockbrokers I have known. Memory, indeed, is half the substance of their art.

On the other hand, statesmen seem to have extraordinarily bad memories. Let two statesmen attempt to recall the same event — what happened, for example, at some Cabinet meeting — and each of them will tell you that the other’s story is so inaccurate that either he has a memory like a **sieve** or is an **audacious** perverter of the truth. The frequency with which the facts in the autobiographies and speeches of statesmen are challenged, suggests that the world has not yet begun to produce ideal statesmen—men who, like great poets, have the genius of memory and of intellect combined.

At the same time, ordinarily good memory is so common that we regard a man who does not possess it as **eccentric**. I have heard of a father who, having offered to take the baby out in a perambulator, was tempted by the sunny morning to pause on his journey and slip into a public-house for a glass of beer. Leaving the perambulator outside, he disappeared through the door of the saloon bar. A little later, his wife had to do some shopping which took her past the public-house, where to her horror, she discovered her sleeping baby. **Indignant** at her husband’s behaviour, she decided to teach him a lesson.

What was **vexation**, however, when just before h her husband came in smiling rfully and asking: “Well, my dear, t’s for lunch today?” having forgotten bout the baby and the fact that he had n it out with him. How many men w the rank of a philosopher would capable of such absent-mindedness his? Most of us, I fear, are born with saically efficient memories. If it were so, the institution of the family could survive in any great modern city.

Human memory gins to work when the etus is just 20 weeks old the mother’s womb.

(reprography), DVDs and CDs are kept.

Most libraries have an online catalogue of holdings (e.g. books, journals, electronic publications and audio-visual materials) available with them. An online catalogue is a list of the materials available in the library, and this list can be accessed through the computer.

You can make use of the online catalogue to locate books and other materials. The most common ways of locating a book are by (i) author’s name (ii) title (iii) subject. If you type the author’s name, e.g. Shakespeare, William, the computer produces a list of all works written by Shakespeare that are available in that library.

Genres of literature are important to learn about. The two main categories separating the different genres of literature are fiction and nonfiction.

Nonfiction includes Narratives Nonfiction, Essays, Biography, Autobiography etc.

Fiction includes Drama, Poetry, Fantasy, Humour, Fables, Science fiction, Short Story etc.

short stories. He has written 50 sci-fi short stories published in various Tamil magazines. His stories have inspired many readers to extend their reading to English sci-fi writers like Isaac Asimov.
