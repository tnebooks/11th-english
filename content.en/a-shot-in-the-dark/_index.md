Here is an amusing story that describes how a man who considers himself very smart and observant finds that he had mistaken the genuine plea of a stranded youth.

**Characters in the story**

Philip Sletherby - a man who aspires to become a politician Mrs. Saltpen-Jago - a rich and influential lady of high rank Bertie - son of Mrs. Saltpen Jago Claude People K.C. - a friend of Sletherby

Philip Sletherby settled himself n in an almost empty railway iage, with the pleasant consciousness eing **embarked** on an agreeable and itable pilgrimage. He was bound Brill Manor, the country residence his newly achieved acquaintance, . Saltpen-Jago. \*Honoria Saltpen-Jago a person of some social importance in don, of considerable importance and uence in the county of Chalkshire.

held for the Government in the present

Parliament by a gentleman who did not

intend to seek re-election, and Sletherby

was under serious consideration by the

party managers as his possible successor,

and with luck, the seat might be held. The

Saltpen-Jago influence was not an item

which could be left out of consideration,

and the political aspirant had been

delighted at meeting Honoria at a small

and friendly luncheon-party, still more

gratified when she had asked him down

to her country house for the following

Friday-to-Tuesday. He was obviously

‘on approval’, and if he could secure the

goodwill of his hostess he might count on

her nominating him as an assured thing.

If he failed to find favour in her eyes —

well, the local leaders would probably cool

off in their embryo enthusiasm for him.

Among the passengers dotted

about on the platform, awaiting their

respective trains, Sletherby **espied** a club

acquaintance, and called him up to the

carriage-window for a chat.

“Oh, you’re staying with

Mrs. Saltpen-Jago for the week-end, are

you? I expect you’ll have a good time; she

has the reputation of being an excellent

hostess. She’ll be useful to you, too, if that

Parliamentary project — hullo, you’re off.

Good-bye.”

“You’ve lost something, haven’t you?” said Sletherby.

“Not exactly, but left behind, which is almost as bad; just as inconvenient, anyway. I’ve come away without my sovereign-purse, with four **quid** in it, all my worldly wealth for the moment. It was in my pocket all right, just before I was starting, and then I wanted to seal a letter, and the sovereign-purse happens to have my crest on it, so I whipped it out to stamp the seal with, and, like a double-distilled idiot, I must have left it on the table. I had some silver loose in my pocket, but after I’d paid for a taxi and my ticket I’d only got this forlorn little six pence left. I’m stopping at a little country inn near Brondquay for three days’ fishing; not a soul knows me there, and my week-end bill, and tips, and cab to and from the station, and my ticket on to Brill, that will mount up to two or three quid, won’t it? If you wouldn’t mind lending me two pound ten, or three for preference, I shall be awfully obliged. It will pull me out of no end of a hole.”

“I think I can manage that,” said Sletherby, after a moment’s hesitation.

“Thanks awfully. It’s jolly good of you. What a lucky thing for me that I should have chanced across one of the mater’s friends. It will be a lesson to me not to leave my **exchequer** lying about anywhere, when it ought to be in my pocket. I suppose the moral of the whole thing is don’t try and convert things to purposes for which they weren’t intended. Still, when a sovereign-purse has your **crest** on it–”

“I’ve never met your mother,” Sletherby suddenly, “though e corresponded several times. My

“She’s supposed to be like me. She the same dark brown hair and high

colour; it runs in her family. I say, this is where I get out.”

“Good-bye,” said Sletherby.

“You’ve forgotten the three quid,” said the young man, opening the carriage- door and pitching his suit-case on to the platform.

“I’ve no intention of lending you three pounds, or three shillings,” said Sletherby severely.

“But you said–”

“I know I did. My suspicions hadn’t been roused then, though I hadn’t necessarily swallowed your story. The **discrepancy** about the crests put me on my guard, notwithstanding the really brilliant way in which you accounted for it. Then I laid a trap for you; I told you that I had never met Mrs. Saltpen-Jago. As a matter of fact I met her at lunch on Monday last. She is a pronounced blonde.”

The train moved on, leaving the **soi-disant** cadet of the Saltpen-Jago family cursing furiously on the platform.

“Well, he hasn’t opened his fishing expedition by catching a flat,” chuckled Sletherby. He would have an entertaining story to recount at dinner that evening, and his clever little trap would earn him applause as a man of resource and **astuteness.** He was still telling his adventure in imagination to an attentive audience of dinner guests when the train drew up at his destination. On the platform he was greeted **sedately** by a tall footman, and noisily by Claude People, K.C., who had apparently travelled down by the same train.

The K.C. was not the sort of man to notice an absorbed silence on the part of a companion. He had been silent himself for nearly an hour in the train, and his tongue was making up for lost time. Political gossip, personal anecdote, and general observation flowed from him in an uninterrupted stream as the car sped along the country roads; from the inner history of the Dublin labour troubles and the private life of the Prince Designate of Albania he progressed with an easy **volubility** to an account of an alleged happening at the ninth hole at Sandwich, and a verbatim report of a remark made by the Duchess of Pathshire at a Tango tea. Just as the car turned in at the Brill entrance gates the K.C. captured Sletherby’s attention by switching his remarks to the personality of their hostess.

“Brilliant woman, level-headed, a clear thinker, knows exactly when to take up an individual or a cause, exactly when to let him or it drop. Influential woman, but spoils herself and her chances by being too restless. No repose. Good appearance, too, till she made that idiotic change.”

“Change?” queried Sletherby, “what change?”

“What change? You don’t mean to say– Oh, of course, you’ve only known her just lately. She used to have beautiful dark brown hair, which went very well with her fresh complexion; then one day, about five weeks ago, she electrified everybody by appearing as a brilliant **blonde**. Quite ruined her looks. Here we are. I say, what’s the matter with you? You look rather ill.”
