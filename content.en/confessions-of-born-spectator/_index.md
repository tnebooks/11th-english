**9\. Parallel reading:**

**Thinking**

“If you think you are beaten, you are, If you think you dare not, you don’t. If you like to win, but you think you can’t, It is almost certain you won’t.

If you think you’ll lose, you’re lost, For out in the world we find, Success begins with a fellow’s will. It’s all in the state of mind.

If you think you are outclassed, you are, You’ve got to think high to rise, You’ve got to be sure of yourself before You can ever win a prize.

Life’s battles don’t always go To the stronger or faster man. But soon or late the man who wins, Is the man who thinks he can.”

**Walter Wintle**
