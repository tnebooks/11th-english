**Here is a story that brings out the bond**

**between the author and his loving**

**grandmother.**

My grandmother, like everybody’s grandmother, was an old woman. She had been old and wrinkled for the twenty years that I had known her. People said that she had once been young and pretty and had even had a husband, but that

being young and pretty, the thought was almost revolting. She often told us of the games she used to play as a child. That seemed quite **absurd** and undignified on her part and we treated it like the **fables** of the Prophets she used to tell us.

She had always been short and fat and slightly bent. Her face was a criss-cross of wrinkles running from everywhere to everywhere. No, we were certain she had always been as we had known her. Old, so terribly old that she could not have grown older, and had stayed at the same age for twenty years. She could never have been pretty; but she was always beautiful. She **hobbled** about the house in spotless white with one hand resting on her waist to balance her stoop and the other telling the beads of her rosary. Her silver locks were scattered untidily over her pale, **puckered** face, and her lips constantly moved in inaudible

prayer. Yes, she was beautiful. She was like the winter landscape in the mountains, an **expanse** of pure white serenity breathing peace and contentment.

My grandmother and I were good friends. My parents left me with her when they went to live in the city and we were constantly together. She used to wake me

in the morning and get me ready for ol. She said her morning prayer in a **otonous** sing-song while she bathed

dressed me in the hope that I would n and get to know it by heart; I listened use I loved her voice but never ered to learn it. Then she would fetch

wooden slate which she had already hed and plastered with yellow chalk, y earthen ink-pot and a red pen, tie all in a bundle and hand it to me.

r a breakfast of a thick, stale chapatti a little butter and sugar spread on it, ent to school. She carried several stale attis with her for the village dogs.

My grandmother always went to ol with me because the school was

ched to the temple. The priest taught he alphabet and the morning prayer. ile the children sat in rows on either of the verandah singing the alphabet e prayer in a chorus, my grandmother

nside reading the scriptures. When we both finished, we would walk back ther. This time the village dogs would t us at the temple door. They followed

o our home growling and fighting with other for the chapatti we threw to .

When my parents were comfortably led in the city, they sent for us. That a turning-point in our friendship. ough we shared the same room, my dmother no longer came to school me. I used to go to an English school

motor bus. There were no dogs in the ets and she took to feeding sparrows e courtyard of our city house.

As the years rolled by, we saw less of

each other. For some time she continued to wake me up and get me ready for school. When I came back she would ask me what the teacher had taught me. I would tell her English words and little things of western science and learning, the law of gravity, Archimedes’ Principle, the world being round etc. This made her unhappy. She could not help me with my lessons. She did not believe in the things they taught at the English school and was distressed that there was no teaching about God and the scriptures. One day, I announced that we were being given music lessons. She said nothing but her silence meant disapproval. She rarely talked to me after that.

When I went up to University, I was given a room of my own. The common link of friendship was **snapped**. My grandmother accepted her **seclusion** with resignation. She rarely left her spinning- wheel to talk to anyone. From sunrise to sunset she sat by her wheel spinning and reciting prayers. Only in the afternoon she relaxed for a while to feed the sparrows. While she sat in the verandah breaking the bread into little bits, hundreds of little birds collected round her creating a veritable **bedlam** of chirruping. Some

came and **perched** on her legs, others on her shoulders. Some even sat on her head.

When I decided to go abroad for her studies, I was sure my grandmother ld be upset. I would be away for five s, and at her age one could never tell.

my grandmother could. She was not sentimental. She came to leave me at

railway station but did not talk or show emotion. Her lips moved in prayer, mind was lost in prayer. Her fingers

e busy telling the beads of her rosary. ntly she kissed my forehead, and when ft I cherished the moist imprint as aps the last sign of physical contact een us.

But that was not so. After five years I e back home and was met by her at the

ion. She did not look a day older. She had no time for words, and while she ped me in her arms I could hear her ting her prayers. Even on the first day y arrival, her happiest moments were her sparrows whom she fed longer

with frivolous **rebukes**.

In the evening a change came over She did not pray. She collected the

en of the neighbourhood, got an drum and started to sing. For several rs she thumped the sagging skins of the **pidated** drum and sang of the home- ing of warriors. We had to persuade to stop to avoid overstraining. That

the first time since I had known her she did not pray.

The next morning she was taken ill. as a mild fever and the doctor told

us that it would go. But my grandmother thought differently. She told us that her end was near. She said that, since only a few hours before the close of the last chapter of her life she had omitted to pray, she was not going to waste any more time talking to us.

We protested. But she ignored our protests. She lay peacefully in bed praying and telling her beads. Even before we could suspect, her lips stopped moving and the rosary fell from her lifeless fingers. A peaceful **pallor** spread on her face and we knew that she was dead.

We lifted her off the bed and, as is customary, laid her on the ground and covered her with a red **shroud**. After a few hours of mourning we left her alone to make arrangements for her funeral. In the evening we went to her room with a crude stretcher to take her to be cremated. The sun was setting and had lit her room and verandah with a blaze of golden light. We stopped half-way in the courtyard. All over the verandah and in her room right up to where she lay dead and stiff wrapped in the red shroud, thousands of sparrows sat scattered on the floor. There was no chirruping. We felt sorry for the birds and my mother fetched some bread for them. She broke it into little crumbs, the way my grandmother used to, and threw it to them. The sparrows took no notice of the bread. When we carried my grandmother’s corpse off, they flew away quietly. Next morning the sweeper swept the bread crumbs into the dustbin.

e) Prefixes and Suffixes.

“Her silver locks were scattered untidily over her pale, puckered face, and her lips constantly moved in **inaudible** prayer.”

In the above sentence, the word ‘inaudible’ is formed by adding the prefix **in-** to the root/base word ‘audible’.

A **prefix** is a letter or a group of letters which is added to the beginning of a root word in order to modify it. Usually, the new word formed is the opposite of the given word.

In the above sentence, we also come across the word ‘constantly’. Here the suffix **–ly** is added to the root word ‘constant’.

A **suffix** is a letter or a group of letters added to the end of a root word. By adding suffixes, the grammatical function of the word changes.

Words that are derived or formed from the base word by adding prefixes and suffixes are called **derivatives**.

**Form two derivatives from each of the**

**following words**.

e.g. honest- dishonest, honesty

manage differ beauty peace arrange collect

approve narrate class

According to Edward Fry, there are three reading speeds: Study reading speed, Average reading speed and Skimming speed. Study reading speed is generally used to read material which demands total comprehension and retention of its meaning, for example, while preparing for an examination. Average reading speed is used for everyday reading of newspapers, magazines and novels etc. Skimming is the fastest reading speed and is generally used for getting an overall idea of the material read. Scanning is another useful tool for speeding up reading. While scanning, you look for specific information without reading everything.

A few practical hints to help you do activities under reading comprehension passages:

1\. Read the passage carefully and try to grasp its main theme.

2\. Pay attention to the meanings of words (connotation), phrases and sentences.

3\. Grasp the manner in which the writer has developed his ideas and thoughts.

4\. Read all the questions in the sequence and conceptualize the answers.

5\. Read the passage again focussing on the content and answer the questions appropriately. Find accurate solutions for vocabulary exercises too.

6\. Go through your answers to check spelling, punctuation and grammar.

4\. Laughter yoga session may start with gentle warm up techniques which include stretching, chanting, clapping, eye contact and body movements to help break down inhibitions and encourage a sense of playfulness.

Breathing exercises are used to prepare the lungs for laughter followed by a series of laughter exercises that combine a method of acting and visualization techniques. Twenty minutes of laughter is sufficient to augment physiological development.

Good morning everyone! Respected Principal, teachers and friends; I am Kumar of Class XI and I stand before you to share a few thoughts on the importance of games and sports in our lives.

Most of us spend our leisure time indoors, watching TV or playing video games. This makes us physically lazy and also leads to many diseases. Mentally we become dull and unimaginative. But all this can be reversed with regular sports activities.

First of all, sports makes us mentally alert and physically strong. Further, good health is one of the most important benefits of games and sports. They help us relax and give us energy to learn our lessons well. Playing games also helps in developing a sense of cooperation or team-spirit in an individual. For example, games like cricket, football, etc. are won by the collective efforts of all the members of the team. They shape our body, give us energy and strength and improve blood circulation.

Sports should be an integral part of education. Education without sports is incomplete. Thus, we should understand that sports is of great value in life. That is why facilities are being developed in rural and semi-urban areas. There are playgrounds everywhere. Let us all remember that a healthy mind can be only in a healthy body and that health is wealth.

I wish to thank you all for having given me the opportunity to speak on the importance of sports and games. Let us pledge to keep ourselves healthy and active by participating more and more in outdoor activities.

Task XI, you ‘Rea deli
