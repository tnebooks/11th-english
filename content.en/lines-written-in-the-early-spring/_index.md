I heard a thousand blended notes
While in a **grove I sate reclined**,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.


To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it **grieved** my heart to think
What Man has made of Man.


Through **primrose tufts**, in that green **bower**,
The **periwinkle** trail’d its **wreaths**;
And ‘tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.


The birds around me hopp’d and play’d
Their thoughts I cannot measure,
But the least motion which they made
It seem’d a thrill of pleasure.


The budding twigs spread out their fan
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.


If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature’s holy plan,
Have I not reason to **lament**
What Man has made of Man?
