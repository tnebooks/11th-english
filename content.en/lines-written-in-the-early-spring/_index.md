**Summer Sun**

Great is the sun, and wide he goes Through empty heaven without repose; And in the blue and glowing days More thick than rain he showers his rays.

Though closer still the blinds we pull To keep the shady parlour cool, Yet he will find a chink or two To slip his golden fingers through.

The dusty attic spider-clad, He, through the keyhole, maketh glad; And through the broken edge of tiles, Into the laddered hay-loft smiles.  

ntime his golden face around bares to all the garden ground, sheds a warm and glittering look

ong the ivy’s inmost nook.

ve the hills, along the blue, nd the bright air with footing true, lease the child, to paint the rose, gardener of the World, he goes.
